# Interactive Maze Game - UON CSY1063 Project

Welcome to the Interactive Maze Game repository. This game is the second part of our first-year project for the University of Northampton's CSY1063 module, following our [Personal Website Portfolio](https://github.com/ryantigi254/Personal-Website-Portfolio).

## Overview

This project is a dynamic, web-based maze game where players navigate through mazes, accumulating points, and avoiding obstacles. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is designed to test the problem-solving skills and reflexes of players.

## JavaScript and AI Integration

The game's interactivity and logic are powered by JavaScript. The scripts handle player movements, collision detection, score tracking, level progression, and game timers.

### AI Components

We plan to integrate various AI components to enrich the gameplay experience:

- Skill-based leveling: The game will adapt to the player's skill level, providing a customized challenge.
- Advancing difficulties: As players progress, the mazes will become more intricate and the obstacles more challenging.
