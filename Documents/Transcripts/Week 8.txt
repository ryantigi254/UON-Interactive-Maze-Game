1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Right. Welcome back
to week eight.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,040
Officially,

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,640
the first assignment
has now been handed in,

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,960
so the majority
of you have

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,560
now submitted
successfully.

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,080
Hopefully, you
should be getting

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,259
your grades back
within four weeks.

8
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,159
Again, our post
announcement and

9
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,440
all the grade grades

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,639
and feedback have
been released.

11
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,239
But generally,
it looks like

12
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,860
performance has been
really good so far.

13
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,060
So hopefully, we can carry

14
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,100
that through to the
second assignment.

15
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,719
For whatever
reason you haven't

16
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,220
submitted at this stage,

17
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,779
you can submit up to
seven days later,

18
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,499
seven days past
the deadline,

19
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:32,639
but that would
be capped to a D

20
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,539
minus anything
later than that.

21
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,219
And unfortunately,

22
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,499
that doesn't count
as a submission,

23
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,195
which would be a G grade.

24
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,390
Again, if you haven't

25
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,630
submitted at this stage,

26
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,349
get it in as urgently as

27
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,250
possible because that
would still count,

28
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,589
it would just be
capped to a D

29
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,970
minus at this late stage.

30
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,029
It's probably a
bit too late to

31
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,570
apply for mitigating
circumstances,

32
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,110
but you can still
possibly try,

33
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,889
sometimes are a bit
lenient on that.

34
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,889
But again, technically

35
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,550
the deadline is
now fully passed.

36
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,029
Do you remember
that's only

37
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:01,350
25% of the
assessment though.

38
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,189
What we're focusing
on now from

39
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,770
weeks eight to 14 is

40
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,509
the 75% the big

41
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,694
chunk key part of
the assessment.

42
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,239
Just before we go into

43
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,200
the electric
content today,

44
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,340
we're just going
to briefly look

45
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,439
back through the
second assignment.

46
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,699
Just Bn is completely

47
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,959
aware of what they're
working towards,

48
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,279
but officially this
assignment was

49
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:17,899
released when

50
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,619
the first assignment
was released.

51
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,459
This was almost just
over two months ago now.

52
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,820
Which was fun.

53
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,180
Yeah, let's crack
into it then.

54
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,200
Your second assignment
is due in on

55
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,205
the 19th of the
fifth 2024.

56
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:33,770
Quite a ways away yet,

57
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,550
so don't worry about it.

58
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,150
Plus, we've got two
weeks off for Easter,

59
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,549
which should
give you ample

60
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,690
opportunity to
have a go at this.

61
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,170
Essentially, you've
got January,

62
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,349
every March, April, May.

63
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,920
It's 19 May,

64
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,730
202-41-1509 This
assignment is

65
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,990
structured a
bit differently

66
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,750
to the one you've
just done.

67
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,569
Essentially,

68
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,715
this is really going
to be focusing on

69
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,400
programming, the
programming side to

70
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,699
web development
with HTML and CSS.

71
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,599
We focused on the
look of these pages,

72
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,140
making them as
optimized and

73
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,260
as fantastic as they
possibly can be,

74
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,960
where we can add
different bits

75
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,999
of content here or there.

76
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,960
With this assignment,
we're primarily

77
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,939
focused on the actual
coding part to it.

78
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,480
Creating variables,

79
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,140
if statements, four loops.

80
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,039
Not only that, but

81
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,699
doing it in an
efficient way.

82
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,359
You could do 1,000

83
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,260
lines to make something
quite simple,

84
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,519
but you could also
achieve the same

85
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,340
result in just
three lines.

86
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,059
That's where a lot of
these marks are from.

87
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,079
Breaking up a little bit.

88
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,800
Assessment two
is essentially

89
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,020
going to assess
your ability to

90
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,519
do HTML, CSS,
and Javascript.

91
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,039
The bulk of this
assignment is going

92
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,560
to be performed
in Javascript.

93
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,799
Must go zoom in just in

94
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,959
case people are
struggling to see.

95
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,079
Now again, the big
difference with

96
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,139
this assignment
is I actually

97
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,439
give you some
code for this.

98
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,700
The idea is you're
going to build

99
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,759
off the code
that I've given

100
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,099
you in Nile bit.

101
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,320
Have a teaser of
what's coming up.

102
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,140
Don't worry.

103
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,179
Let's go going to

104
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:59,340
a student preview
very quickly.

105
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,449
If you go to
assessments and

106
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,289
submissions in AS two,

107
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,929
these are
currently the only

108
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,010
assessment items
I've released.

109
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,090
Eventually, we will have

110
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,049
the submission
points in there.

111
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:10,729
I'll probably also

112
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:11,969
create a video
demonstration

113
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,649
walking you through the
submission process.

114
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:14,490
It's a little bit

115
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,069
different to the
first assignment.

116
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,689
The first assignment
we used to get

117
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,469
Hub and get this one.

118
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,249
It's not the way

119
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:21,250
you're actually
going to submit

120
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,510
this is just getting
all your code,

121
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,689
putting it into a zip file

122
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,934
and then submitting
that zip file.

123
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,759
I'd recommend you download

124
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,859
the AS two zip file

125
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,039
because this is
essentially what you're

126
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,819
going to be building
the assignment from.

127
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,819
When you open up the
AS two zip file,

128
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,300
you get greeted
to something

129
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
like realize
that's the grade,

130
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,459
apologies you get
greeted to this.

131
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,900
It's a very basic template

132
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,680
for a game, completely
original game.

133
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,980
I haven't stolen
it from anywhere.

134
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,319
Obviously, it's my own

135
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,360
individual property
patent pending.

136
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,944
But this is
called Snack Man,

137
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,790
essentially. It's a very
simple Pac Man game.

138
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,829
I've given you the
basic gooey for this.

139
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,129
So you've got the
maze, you've got

140
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,390
the characters, you've
got the leaderboard,

141
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,549
You've got these
button prompts,

142
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,229
which my camera is
annoyingly hiding where.

143
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:09,530
You've got the
button prompts here,

144
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,769
you've got this nice
score, and you've

145
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,510
got these levels
up in the corner.

146
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,129
I put these in for you.

147
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,710
Essentially, your
assignment is

148
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,750
to build the functionality
for this game.

149
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,290
Now the game of the
game is to move

150
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,689
the player
around the maze,

151
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,729
collecting the points.

152
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,349
Once they've collected
all the points,

153
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,204
that game should
come to an end.

154
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:27,720
The player
shouldn't be able

155
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,879
to go through the
walls of the maze,

156
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,920
and when they
encounter one of

157
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,780
the enemy characters,

158
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,239
the game should also end.

159
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,939
Again, putting
out perspective.

160
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,700
You shouldn't be able

161
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,599
to go through these walls,

162
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,219
you need to be able to
collect these points.

163
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:38,319
And if I encounter one of

164
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,279
these green circles,
the game should end.

165
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,960
That's like the end state.

166
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,859
We have a score

167
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,179
counter up here
that should also

168
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,020
reflect the number of

169
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,539
points you collect
in the maze.

170
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,459
Now, I've not
been too cruel,

171
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,920
I have given you a bit

172
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,400
of functionality for this.

173
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,979
The functionality I've
given you is moving

174
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,439
the character around the
maze with the rakes.

175
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,539
We can move the character,

176
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,295
but that's
really about it.

177
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,830
Everything else
you're going

178
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,889
to have to do yourselves,

179
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,750
so you've got to create
some collision so

180
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,610
the character can't just

181
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,690
walk through these walls.

182
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,290
You're going to need

183
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,130
that same collision to

184
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,089
work for these points as

185
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,769
well and also
the collision

186
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,129
to work on the
enemy characters.

187
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,209
The idea is my encounter

188
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,370
one of these
enemy characters.

189
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,209
It's game over.
Essentially nice

190
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,450
and simple of essentially,

191
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,030
you're going to make

192
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,779
this game fully
functional.

193
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,050
Getting into

194
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,769
the specific requirements
for the brief.

195
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,150
Then they're
separated into

196
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,529
the grade boundaries.

197
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,889
Right here, we've
got everything

198
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,489
you need for a bare pass,

199
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:32,669
a D minus to a D plus.

200
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,850
Okay? We also then
have a good pass,

201
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,509
a very good pass, and
an excellent pass,

202
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,970
and it goes on like that.

203
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,250
But we'll just
focus on the

204
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,290
passing criteria
to begin with.

205
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,810
The first requirement is

206
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,049
when the start
button is pressed,

207
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,710
the game should begin, and

208
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,990
the start button should
no longer be visible.

209
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,770
That essentially
means when I click on

210
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,229
this start button,
it should disappear.

211
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,609
Hopefully,
everyone should be

212
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:54,949
able to achieve
that after today,

213
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,605
though, it's one of the
easier requirements.

214
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,100
The next one is the
player should not be able

215
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,739
to move until

216
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,179
the start button
has been pressed.

217
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,820
Right now, I can move
around the screen

218
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,199
without pressing
the Start button.

219
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,320
That movement needs to be

220
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,759
locked behind the
Start button.

221
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,419
So the idea is I click
the Start button,

222
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,619
I can then move the
character effectively.

223
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:14,640
When you press Start,
it starts the game.

224
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,260
You need to stop
the player from

225
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,899
walking through
the mazes walls.

226
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,439
The walls of the maze
are these blue squares.

227
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,060
They're also dotted around

228
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,260
the center of the
maze as well.

229
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,300
You basically
just need to add

230
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,620
that collision in because
like I said right

231
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,560
now we can walk through

232
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
them and it's not very

233
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,700
good when

234
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,319
the player touches
one of the points.

235
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,059
The points are

236
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,679
the small white
circles in the maze.

237
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,900
You need to remove
the point from

238
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,400
the maze and get

239
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
this score counter
to go up by one.

240
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,759
Essentially,

241
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
the player is
collecting these points

242
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,339
and this point counter

243
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,539
reflects the
number of points

244
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,239
the players achieved.

245
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,800
Basically.
Obviously, right now

246
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,560
we're on zero because

247
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,300
we haven't collected any.

248
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,399
Oh,

249
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,509
once all the points

250
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,869
have been collected
by the player,

251
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,870
you need to display
a game over message,

252
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,709
just signifying that
the game has ended.

253
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,570
Again, this is
quite easy to do.

254
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,890
You can either use
the Start button

255
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,249
or you could do what's
called an alert,

256
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:08,890
which we'll get
into later today.

257
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,449
But effectively, once
you've collected

258
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,029
all the points,
it's game over.

259
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,790
Then the last one is if

260
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,249
the player touches
the enemy,

261
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:17,950
you need to have

262
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,049
the same game over
message appear.

263
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,389
And the player will also

264
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,769
display the
dead animation.

265
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:25,030
That's just using
the CSS class dead.

266
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,630
You're just going to
put this class on

267
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,270
the player and that
should make them die.

268
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,070
Let's see this in action.

269
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,629
The benefits of
having branches,

270
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,529
so I can't move
the character.

271
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,690
The second I click Start,

272
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,050
the start button
disappears

273
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,750
and I can then move
the character.

274
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,510
I can then collect
these points.

275
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,890
And you can see the
point counts wrap in

276
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,830
the corner going
up by one.

277
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,250
I can't go through the
walls of the maze.

278
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,425
There is collision there.

279
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:58,479
If I collect
all the points,

280
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,440
it's the game over.

281
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,040
But if I also encounter
this enemy character,

282
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,080
it's game over as well.

283
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,659
Now I've used
the Start button

284
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,000
to signify it's game over.

285
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
But if you had
another method of

286
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,660
showing its game over,

287
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,840
that would also be fine.

288
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,799
Like I said from today,

289
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,799
we are going to
look at alerts,

290
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,240
maybe use alerts, why not?

291
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,740
That's everything you need

292
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,634
for a bar pass, though,

293
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,649
essentially start button

294
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,990
pressed, it disappears.

295
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,290
The player shouldn't
be able to

296
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,149
move until the start
button has been pressed.

297
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,969
When the player
touches the points

298
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:30,229
that collects the points,

299
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,410
you need the wall
collision in

300
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,989
there and then you

301
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:34,349
need to signify
it's game over.

302
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,110
When the two game

303
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,249
over states have
been reached,

304
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,989
that's when all the
points are collected or

305
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:38,849
when the player

306
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,550
encounters the
enemy character.

307
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,549
Everyone at a minimum
needs to achieve this.

308
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,149
Without this, you're not

309
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,550
going to pass the asylum.

310
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,449
The nice thing is
every single lecture

311
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,129
from this moment on is

312
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,289
built around each of
these requirements.

313
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:54,769
Today we're focused on

314
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,930
adding event listeners,

315
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,990
which is going
to be absolutely

316
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,424
crucial to these
first two steps.

317
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:00,819
The week after that,

318
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:01,720
we're going to be focusing

319
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,760
more on specifically
targeting elements,

320
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
which will be useful for

321
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
pretty much all
this criteria.

322
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,079
When we come back
after Easter,

323
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,499
we're focused on
collision detection,

324
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,099
which is huge
when it comes to

325
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,620
the collision
for the walls

326
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,300
and the collision
for the points.

327
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,739
Again, each lecture is

328
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,399
designed to
build upon this.

329
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,239
Don't panic if you
don't know it.

330
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,300
We're only on lecture one,

331
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,334
Bajavascript. Okay,

332
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:26,189
For a good pass, it

333
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,710
does get
progressively harder.

334
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,930
You need to randomize

335
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,470
the position of the
enemies at the start.

336
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,990
With the bar
pass criteria,

337
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,190
that enemy is
always going to be

338
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,650
in exactly the same place.

339
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,409
Okay? Nothing's
changing with

340
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:41,229
that enemy when we
get into a good pass,

341
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:43,590
that's the grade criteria.

342
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,889
We're randomizing
these positions.

343
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,809
Each time I
click, refresh,

344
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:50,410
every time I refresh
the browser,

345
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,370
these positions
get randomized.

346
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,610
In theory, the game

347
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,550
is never going
to be the same

348
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,219
now because we're

349
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,399
randomizing
these positions.

350
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,539
Another requirement is
just making sure that

351
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,980
where these enemies spawn

352
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,160
in, it's appropriate.

353
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,340
For example, the
enemies aren't

354
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,759
going to be spawning
outside the maze.

355
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,919
They won't be
spawning where

356
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,060
the walls of the maze are.

357
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,080
They're only going to
be spawning inside

358
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,280
the maze where
there's a free space,

359
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,059
that's where we're going

360
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,640
to put those enemies.

361
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,160
By enemies, I mean the
green circle, so play.

362
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,699
Everyone's okay with
that terminology,

363
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,780
This is quite tricky.

364
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,260
You also need
to add random

365
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,180
movement to these enemies.

366
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,860
The idea is
they're not just

367
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,080
static, they're not
just staying there.

368
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,939
They're actually
going to be

369
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,060
moving throughout
the maze.

370
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,660
There are bonus
points available

371
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,240
if they don't get stuck.

372
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
If they come into
contact with a wall,

373
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,980
they shouldn't just
stay on that wall.

374
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,599
They should hit the
wall and go into

375
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,519
the opposite direction or

376
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,040
go into a new direction.

377
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,659
If they get stuck,
you'll lose

378
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,920
a few marks here or there.

379
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,960
But the point I want

380
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,840
to make with
this is you're

381
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,920
also having the
wall collision

382
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,820
on the enemies itself.

383
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,200
Now if you've done
this properly,

384
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,120
so if you've done this
with the past criteria

385
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,159
in a good way, you
should be able to re,

386
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,860
use that method,
that way of doing

387
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,980
it in this if
that makes sense.

388
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,219
Trying to be quite
vague on that.

389
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,020
The enemies also
need to stop

390
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,520
moving when

391
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,544
the game overstate
has been reached.

392
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:13,809
Once the player has
collected all the points,

393
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,130
obviously there's
been a collision

394
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,309
between the enemy
and the player,

395
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,470
that's also game over.

396
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,890
The next one is,
instead of saying

397
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,870
game over, try
displaying restart.

398
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,169
This will allow
the player to

399
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,690
restart the game instead

400
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,969
of having to just be

401
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,150
over and clicking refresh.

402
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,850
Essentially, when
you click restart,

403
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,650
the game resets back
to its original state.

404
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,089
That would be
all the points

405
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:36,929
being back in the maze,

406
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,929
the players position
being back where it was,

407
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,009
and the enemies being in

408
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,810
a new randomized location.

409
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,170
It's effectively the same

410
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,349
as refreshing the browser.

411
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:46,029
Essentially, instead
of game over,

412
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,870
it's going to say restart

413
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,269
or play again.
For instance,

414
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,390
the last one, which
is a bit easier,

415
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,490
I think I always
like to throw one

416
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,589
of the easy ones
in this one,

417
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,470
because I think a lot of

418
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,009
this criteria is
quite challenging.

419
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:57,769
Is I want you to

420
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,130
implement those
arrow buttons,

421
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,989
the arrow buttons in
the corner over here.

422
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,370
I want you to
implement them,

423
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,130
so I'll just
hide my camera.

424
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,169
Now the difference
with this is

425
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,490
if I click on the
arrow button,

426
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,470
the player will continue

427
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,869
moving in that direction.

428
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,370
Whereas with
the arrow keys,

429
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,230
I've got to be pressing

430
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,649
the arrow key
for it to move.

431
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,090
With these
buttons you just

432
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,509
click on it and it
will continue moving

433
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,170
the more I click.

434
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,790
Shouldn't increase
the players speed.

435
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,130
That's sometimes a
common error that I see.

436
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,730
Depending on how you built

437
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,950
this, I'm going to die.

438
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,489
That's a shame, that's

439
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,469
allowing me to show you

440
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:31,810
the restart feature,
which is nice.

441
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,230
If I click restart,
the game restarts.

442
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,929
You can have
these players,

443
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,069
these enemy characters,
moving immediately.

444
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,390
I chose to delay it by
a couple of seconds,

445
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,309
just so it's a
bit more fun,

446
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:43,810
although it's
not particularly

447
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,690
fun at the moment.

448
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,690
But can you see that they

449
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,950
have got wall collisions?

450
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,449
The idea is when they
encounter a wall,

451
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,150
they move in the
opposite direction.

452
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,810
I'm going to die again.

453
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm not doing very well.

454
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,049
But then once

455
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,350
the game overstate
has been reached,

456
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,070
the player movement stops.

457
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,970
That's pretty much
everything you need

458
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,390
for a grade on this one.

459
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,249
This is a good pass.

460
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,709
If you've achieved
quite a bit of this,

461
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,150
you're in quite
a good position,

462
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,770
which is nice

463
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,149
for a very good
pass. This one

464
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,870
is quite a bit
more challenging.

465
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,670
You need to ask the player

466
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,669
for their name at the,

467
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,829
at the end game state.

468
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,409
Once the players died or

469
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:21,470
collected all the points,

470
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,630
you need to ask
them for their

471
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,050
name and then save

472
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,370
their name along
with the score.

473
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,369
Apologies, I
can't talk today.

474
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,430
You're saving the
name with the score

475
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,090
the player achieved into

476
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,009
something called
local storage.

477
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,970
You're then
going to display

478
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,569
the five highest player

479
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,289
scores in the leaderboard.

480
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,490
The leaderboard is this
section just here.

481
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,249
You're actually going to

482
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,390
make this
leaderboard fully

483
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,589
functional based on

484
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,950
the players that have
played this game.

485
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,299
You then need to organize

486
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,719
the leaderboard from
highest to lowest.

487
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,680
Again, typically
it's built

488
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,120
in the relative order,

489
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,599
which means the
newer entries

490
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,800
will appear at the bottom.

491
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,760
You need to reorganize
this using some thing,

492
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,559
Again, being quite
vague with it.

493
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,580
You need to sort it
by the highest score.

494
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,060
So it goes highest
to lowest.

495
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm pretty sure
there's something

496
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,159
about limiting it to five.

497
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,739
There is also a
limit of five.

498
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,460
Only have the five highest

499
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,879
scores on that
leaderboard.

500
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,120
I think I missed that bit

501
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,500
annoyingly. That's fine.

502
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,160
Once you've got the
leaderboard working,

503
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,839
you then need to
add the players

504
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,100
lives using Java Script.

505
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,240
Looking at the
HTML very quickly,

506
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,359
the players
lives are added.

507
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:38,320
This just here,
these list items

508
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,020
are basically these lives,

509
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,464
they're currently hard
coded into the HTML.

510
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:46,149
Your job is to make this

511
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:49,249
fully based around
Java script,

512
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:49,769
so you're adding

513
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,810
these list items
through Java script.

514
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,409
That's slightly
easier to do.

515
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,429
To be fair, you
then need to make

516
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,090
some functionality
that states

517
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,149
when the player collides

518
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,110
with the enemy characters.

519
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,409
Instead of it
being game over

520
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,569
immediately
you're going to

521
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,449
remove one of the,

522
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:05,249
remove one of the
lives and make it

523
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,390
so that the player
is unable to

524
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,450
move for 1.5 seconds,

525
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,590
you're going to put
the hit animation

526
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,190
on that player again,

527
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,210
signifying that
they've been

528
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,450
hit by the enemy
character.

529
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,909
Just to reiterate
that when you

530
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:19,869
come into contact with
an enemy character,

531
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,709
stop the movement
of the player.

532
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,869
Put the hit class on them.

533
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,690
And then after 1.5

534
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,990
seconds allow them
to move again.

535
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,130
But the key is to removing

536
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,669
one of the lights
from the screen.

537
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,930
The player essentially has

538
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,029
three attempts
for all this.

539
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,690
Once all three
lives are lost,

540
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,390
you're then going to

541
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,770
display that
restart message

542
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,289
or that game over message.

543
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,549
This is significantly
harder, I would say.

544
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,449
This is partly some

545
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:45,589
of the hardest criteria
on this assignment.

546
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,630
So good luck
moving forward.

547
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,210
Then let's go to B grade,
which is very fun.

548
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,089
I'm going to hide that
I realized that could

549
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:56,409
be not good to demonstrate
the leaderboard,

550
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,210
then I'll just collect

551
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,230
a couple of points
in the maze.

552
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,130
Although I get
the impression

553
00:15:59,130 --> 00:15:59,969
I'm going to get hit in,

554
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,230
no, I managed to avoid it.

555
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,910
That's good. We'll
get hit once.

556
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,650
We'll try and
get hit again.

557
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,749
So we got hit
again on that one.

558
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:12,130
We unfortunately got hit

559
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,470
third time, which is fine.

560
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,469
I'll just put my name

561
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:15,349
Chris in the leaderboard.

562
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,469
Click okay on that one.

563
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,569
And Chris with a score

564
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:18,889
of four then got saved to

565
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,669
the leaderboard by try and

566
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:22,670
restart and do a
similar process.

567
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,150
So I'll click to
govern more points.

568
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,919
We'll get hit, we

569
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,319
got hit again
unfortunately,

570
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,640
and we got hit
on the way back.

571
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,620
As well as the way
the game goes,

572
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,100
sometimes we'll just put

573
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,739
another name on this,

574
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:37,720
so we'll just
say John Quick.

575
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,359
Okay. And that
scored the lead of

576
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,579
order because
that score was

577
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,259
higher than the score
I previously got.

578
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,020
That's taken the
number one position.

579
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,560
If I were to get
another score,

580
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,959
for example two or one

581
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,580
that would appear
in the third slot,

582
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,500
they are ordered by
the score itself.

583
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,760
That's the leaderboard.

584
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,420
And the cool thing is,

585
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,000
because this is
using local storage,

586
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,660
but click Refresh now

587
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,980
that leaderboard
still stays the same.

588
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,680
Now local storage is
based on your laptop.

589
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,980
This score only exists

590
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,700
on your machine,
unfortunately,

591
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,499
until we look into
servicide languages

592
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,400
where we can save
things to databases,

593
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,499
this is about the best we

594
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,119
can do at this stage.

595
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,299
But don't worry,
you'll learn this in,

596
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,539
I think it's week 11,
which is very fun.

597
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,519
That is for a
very good purse.

598
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,679
And again, this is some of

599
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,340
the more challenging
parts of the assignment.

600
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,300
In my opinion, not
only do you need

601
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,459
to work with local storage

602
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,519
where you're
saving schools,

603
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,180
you're also sorting
those schools

604
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,840
and limiting them to five,

605
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,050
which does require
more complex logic.

606
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,180
Not only that, you're
also implementing

607
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,580
a whole life function

608
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,379
which has

609
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,340
a lot more challenges
than you might think.

610
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,540
For example, in some cases

611
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,039
you can get all
three lives

612
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,180
disappearing at
the same time.

613
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,920
That's because the
player in the enemy,

614
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,319
there's no time
to stop on that.

615
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,559
So it's constantly
removing

616
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
the same life over and
over and over again.

617
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,020
You need some way of
pausing that collision.

618
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,999
There's a lot to
it, unfortunately,

619
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,964
which you'll come out
the better for it.

620
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,910
For an excellent
pass. This one's

621
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,449
a bit more fun
in my opinion.

622
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,649
You might have noticed

623
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:05,890
at this current
point there's

624
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,150
only a limited
number of points

625
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,469
we can actually
get on this maze.

626
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:09,630
The idea is
once we collect

627
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,269
all these points,
that's it.

628
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:12,949
Which means the
highest score

629
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:15,150
is pretty much always
going to be the same.

630
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,310
Which makes the
leaderboard

631
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,204
a bit less fun,
in my opinion.

632
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:22,340
What part of the excellent

633
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,599
passing criteria is,

634
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,899
is you're doing levels

635
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,419
of increasing difficulty.

636
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,500
The idea is once
the players

637
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,939
successfully collected
all those points,

638
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:32,999
you're going to
refresh the maze

639
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,019
and you're going to have

640
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,459
all those points back in.

641
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,059
Now the idea for this is

642
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,400
there's going to
be levels now.

643
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Level one could
be quite easy,

644
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,980
level two could be harder,

645
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,040
level three
could be harder.

646
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,399
You can go on
and on. Now to

647
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,279
get the most number
of marks for this,

648
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,795
the maze needs to
change for each level.

649
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,629
There's two ways
you can do this.

650
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,529
You can have preset levels

651
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,589
or for the higher marks,

652
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:56,970
you can randomize
that mazes creation.

653
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,309
What that means is
it's going to be

654
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,669
a random maze
every single time.

655
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,050
Just demonstrating
this slightly,

656
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,410
I go to the A grade
when I quit refresh.

657
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,729
It's a brand new maze.

658
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,609
Every single time, if

659
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,129
I were to collect
all these points,

660
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:14,829
I move on to level two and

661
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,729
it's a new maze that
gets refreshed.

662
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:17,989
The idea is in theory,

663
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,124
this game could
go on forever.

664
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,400
Now part of the
requirement

665
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,619
is levels of
increasing difficulty.

666
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,600
One way of achieving
this is to add

667
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,019
more enemies to the game

668
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,539
as the levels increase.

669
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,159
For example, level
one could have

670
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,400
one enemy character
like I've got here.

671
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,919
The second I get
to level two,

672
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,460
there's then two
enemy characters,

673
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,619
three enemy characters,

674
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,719
four enemy characters for

675
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,379
every single level
that goes up.

676
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,299
Now if you had an infinite
number of levels,

677
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,019
there would need to
be some cap on this.

678
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,439
Otherwise you'd
end up with like

679
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,220
1,000 enemies at level

680
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,319
1,000 Maybe it caps off at

681
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,359
maybe ten enemies when it

682
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,379
gets a bit more
unmanageable.

683
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,979
But the real key to this

684
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:57,659
is it's going to be
a randomized maze.

685
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,140
For each level, there's

686
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,279
bonus marks if there

687
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,680
are an infinite
number of levels.

688
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,940
And the nice thing
is that it's

689
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,540
quite easy to achieve,
which is nice.

690
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,699
Now you would
lose marks if

691
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,340
the maze is
impossible to solve.

692
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,979
What I mean by that is if

693
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,020
we had a wall here
and a wall here,

694
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,300
my player
character wouldn't

695
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,099
be able to get
these two points.

696
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,799
There Doesn't need
to be something in

697
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,119
place to stop that
from happening.

698
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,280
Annoyingly,

699
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,780
that took me quite
a while to solve.

700
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,619
It's actually a
very easy issue,

701
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,999
but hopefully you
guys figure it

702
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,540
out a lot quicker
than me on that one.

703
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,780
Let's try and get to
level two on this one.

704
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,980
So unfortunately,
you've got to watch

705
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,939
me very slowly go
through this game,

706
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:41,660
which is fun to be a fair,

707
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,539
is quite a fun game to

708
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:44,639
the idea is as soon as I

709
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,679
collect all of
these points,

710
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,740
which we are very
nearly there,

711
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,679
it's going to wait for

712
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,120
that character to move.

713
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,160
I'm playing it
dangerously Now

714
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,549
of course, he's going
to go right where I

715
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,449
need to go. That's fine.

716
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,809
There we go. So
as soon as I

717
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:15,489
collect this last
point just here,

718
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:18,429
it tells me the level
has been completed.

719
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:19,509
It then gives me

720
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,170
a new maze and the
game continues.

721
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,769
But this time because
I'm on level two,

722
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:23,149
I've got

723
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,729
two enemy characters
I'm dealing with.

724
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,689
But you can see in theory,

725
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,269
I could get like

726
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:30,789
an infinite number
of points on this.

727
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,110
Now we'll just try

728
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,169
and die very quickly so I

729
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,349
can get a very
nice high score.

730
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:42,290
When I show this
in glass, I am.

731
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,529
Oh come on. There we go.

732
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,149
We'll just say
Chris two on that

733
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:51,890
one now at my score of 67.

734
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,050
Finale to the leaderboard.

735
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,930
Like So that's

736
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,330
the key to success
for that one.

737
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,609
In theory, this
game could go on

738
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,430
forever, forever and ever.

739
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,189
And it's still got the
same functionalities.

740
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:03,450
I click restart, the
game restarts as well.

741
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,849
That was unfortunate,
but the point with

742
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:08,089
the grade is it's not

743
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,270
premade levels,
it's infinite.

744
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,029
If you did do premade
levels, for example,

745
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,930
level one is this and
level two is this maze,

746
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,329
and level three
is this maze.

747
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,109
That would get
you some marks.

748
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:19,830
But if it's completely
randomized every time,

749
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,269
that's the key to the

750
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,710
highest grade
boundary on that one.

751
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,149
Now the last
requirement for this,

752
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,890
it's the one that
I really encourage

753
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,630
most people to try

754
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,969
because I think
it's quite fun.

755
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:33,109
It adds a bit more
personalization to this is

756
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,750
I want you to add two

757
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,789
unique features
to this game.

758
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,389
The more complex
the features,

759
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,190
the higher the
mark you will get.

760
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,070
If it were me, I
would possibly

761
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,189
look at doing some
power up feature.

762
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:45,529
In traditional Pac Man,

763
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:46,989
you get the fruit

764
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:48,449
that's slightly different
from the rest of

765
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:49,769
the fruit that gives you

766
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,409
more points.

767
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,989
You could do
something like that.

768
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:53,410
For example, you could

769
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,490
have maybe a red point.

770
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,010
Somewhere on this, you
collect the red point

771
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,329
that gives you ten
in your score.

772
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,289
You could add
modifiers to it.

773
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,929
For example, if you
were to collect

774
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,949
a certain thing
in the maze,

775
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:05,629
it would speed up

776
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:06,869
your character
for 10 seconds.

777
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,549
Or it makes you
invisible or invincible,

778
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,110
that's the word
I've meant to use.

779
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,969
Or you could take it
literally from Pac Man.

780
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:14,909
You could allow
yourself to defeat

781
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:16,950
the enemies in the
maze temporarily.

782
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,510
If you come into
contact with them,

783
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,030
they're the ones that
die and disappear.

784
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,759
You can even do

785
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,659
a character customizer
if you really want to.

786
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,519
This is going to be one of

787
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,240
your exercises in
two weeks time.

788
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,519
We're actually
going to create

789
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,999
some character
customize it.

790
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,479
Very easy to just port
that over into this,

791
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,939
but the key is the more
complex the feature,

792
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,959
the higher the mark
you receive on this.

793
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,740
I would encourage
most people

794
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,659
to give this one a go.

795
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,719
I think that's something I

796
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,700
quite like with
this assignment.

797
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,419
A lot of people think

798
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:44,860
they have to do
this in order,

799
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,820
not necessarily the case

800
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,640
if you think there's
a few things,

801
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,199
let's say in the
very good pass,

802
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,880
that seem easier
than this one.

803
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,419
In a good pass, you

804
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,664
can add those
for those marks.

805
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:58,109
Even if you haven't
achieved all of this,

806
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,110
you can still do some
of the requirements

807
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,029
for an A grade,
for a B grade.

808
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,569
Each of these have
a certain number

809
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,290
of points
allocated to them.

810
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,349
All you're going to do is

811
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:07,609
rack up those points.

812
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,570
You don't have to
follow a specific order

813
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,930
on this, if that
makes sense.

814
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,050
I would say is a major
requirement though.

815
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,089
Everyone needs to have
done the past grade.

816
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,089
The past grade has

817
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,329
the most number
of marks to it,

818
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,609
because that's enough
to get you that

819
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:21,629
40% 40% for the D minus.

820
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:23,069
The rest of this
stuff is only

821
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,310
maybe ten marks each.

822
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,209
Ten marks between
each grade boundary,

823
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:27,965
if that makes sense.

824
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,639
But yeah, have
some fun with it.

825
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:31,759
I'll just go through a

826
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,140
bit more on the
assignment.

827
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,000
You've got a few
different CSS

828
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,420
classes at your disposal.

829
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,359
The big ones are
obviously hashtag player,

830
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,619
which is an ID
for the player

831
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,319
that's that Pac
Man character.

832
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,399
There's a secondary
action for these players.

833
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,160
There's the hit class
and the dead class.

834
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
The dead class gives

835
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,300
you that death animation,

836
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,319
whereas the hit class
gives you that hit.

837
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,639
It's being hit animation.

838
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,439
We then have
classes for the

839
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,559
points and the
enemies as well.

840
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,460
But hopefully it's quite

841
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,454
straightforward
from the CSS.

842
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,949
Now for the actual
assignment submission,

843
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,609
you need to
create a report.

844
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:03,769
This report is
going to be very

845
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,069
different from the
report you made for

846
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,609
the first assignment
because this one's

847
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:09,249
got quite a lot of
marks associated to it.

848
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,249
You're going to have

849
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:11,709
three sections
in this report.

850
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,709
The first one is
a checklist of

851
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,290
all the completed
functionality

852
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,090
that you've done.

853
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,549
I'm going to give
you a template to

854
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,970
use for this in a
couple of weeks time.

855
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,050
That's got every single

856
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,729
feature I'm looking for.

857
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,349
Everything in all of

858
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,849
this nice thing is you

859
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:25,490
can use it to track

860
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,610
your progress,
which is good.

861
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,489
All you need to do is

862
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:28,670
just tell me what
you've done.

863
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,249
If you've done all
the past grade,

864
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:31,750
you'll tick all of these.

865
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,209
Just make marking a
little bit easier on me.

866
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:34,709
Otherwise,

867
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:37,000
it'll be scouring
through a lot of code.

868
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,349
That's the first
one. Just tell me

869
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:40,190
exactly what you've

870
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,929
done using that checklist.

871
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:44,130
The second section
is testing.

872
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,609
We're going to
focus a lot more on

873
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:46,950
testing in some of
the later weeks.

874
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,890
But you've got to show

875
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,389
me how the code
is working.

876
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,270
What tests have
you performed

877
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,610
that guarantee that's

878
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,389
working? As you've stated.

879
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,709
Could you test
certain sections

880
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,009
without running
all the code?

881
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,330
A bit of a hint you can,

882
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,430
then this is quite
a unique one.

883
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,790
If there are any
bugs in your game,

884
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,930
if you disclose them here,

885
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,950
you won't be marked down

886
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,810
quite as heavily for them.

887
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,429
Again, if you know some of

888
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:13,244
it doesn't work,
mention it

889
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:16,640
for the evaluation.
Essentially, you're

890
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,019
just going to say what

891
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,579
happened throughout
this process.

892
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,979
Again, any known bugs

893
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,200
or weaknesses in the game.

894
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,720
Tell me what works
well in the game

895
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,219
if you're very proud of
your collision Tion,

896
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,860
maybe it's 100% accurate
every single time.

897
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,039
Talk about that. If you

898
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,759
had more time or
what would you do?

899
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,480
What improvements could
you make to the game?

900
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,660
What would you have
done if you were given

901
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,879
an extra week or an
extra month on this?

902
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,939
How easy is it to extend

903
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:40,600
the functionality
for this game?

904
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,379
Have you built it in

905
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:42,739
such a way that
it's very modular?

906
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,279
You just need to
create a new function

907
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,400
and then bag it's working?

908
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,240
Or is it very
much written into

909
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,520
one solid block where

910
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,499
a tiny tweak here

911
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,479
or there could
break everything.

912
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,519
The last one is
if you had to

913
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,619
build a similar
game in the future,

914
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,539
what would you do
differently and why you

915
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,419
get to express your
English skills,

916
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,620
which is very fun.

917
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,219
The last little
bit is then

918
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,899
a link to your video
demonstration.

919
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,239
This video
demonstration is a

920
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:07,580
bit longer than the
first assignment,

921
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,559
just because
you've essentially

922
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,580
got to show me
everything you've

923
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,920
done, two to 5 minutes.

924
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,820
Try not to make it
any longer than ten,

925
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,879
otherwise that's going to

926
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,660
be very painful to watch.

927
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,779
But essentially, you're
just going to show me

928
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,320
all the features you've
added to that game.

929
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,580
You don't need to
show me the code,

930
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,519
it's just the game
itself. Okay?

931
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,379
You also need to
copy and paste

932
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,919
all your code into
a Word document

933
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,279
and scan that
through turn in,

934
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,280
just like the
first assignment.

935
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,619
The actual rubric itself,

936
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,100
the functionality part,

937
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,459
the stuff you're adding

938
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:42,759
to this is worth
60% of your grade.

939
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,160
It's quite a big chunk.

940
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,619
All of this stuff, this

941
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,239
is all worth 60%
of that grade.

942
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,320
Again, don't look
at that lightly.

943
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,620
It's the biggest section
in this assignment

944
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,099
for the evaluation
and testing.

945
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,719
This is mostly the
report section.

946
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,340
They're 10% each,
That's 20% Again,

947
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,379
it does have to be
quite a good report.

948
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,124
I would say maybe five
pages is even that.

949
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:09,090
But again, 20
whole percent,

950
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,230
that's quite a lot code

951
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,369
quality and efficiency.

952
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:13,749
That's where I'm
specifically

953
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:14,429
going to be looking

954
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,709
at your code and
seeing how good it is.

955
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:18,309
If you've got a lot of
duplication in there,

956
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,310
are you using a good
range of functions?

957
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,209
Are you using four
loops? If statements,

958
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,390
everything we're
going to go through.

959
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,829
Are you using
it effectively?

960
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,730
That's where 15% then

961
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,089
you've got 5% of the
video demonstration.

962
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,770
But just like the
first assignment,

963
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,969
this is more of a pass or

964
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,849
fail section
on the rubric.

965
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:34,870
You've either done

966
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,549
a good video
demonstration where it

967
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,789
proves that
that's your code

968
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,169
or there's a bit
of ambiguity.

969
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,509
There were a bit unsure

970
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,670
and that's where
you'll fail

971
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,989
that section and
be called in for

972
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,694
a secondary
interview for that.

973
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:48,120
But that is the
second assignment.

974
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,099
So remember, you've got

975
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,539
quite a lot of
time to do this,

976
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:51,900
so don't panic just yet.

977
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,380
You've even got two
weeks over Easter,

978
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,039
surprisingly,

979
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,519
but we will come
back to this as

980
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,240
each week goes
on after today,

981
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,580
you can actually
do the first two

982
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,599
requirements of this game.

983
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,860
Again, if you're doing

984
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,980
the exercises each week,

985
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,739
it should be very
easy to see what

986
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:09,719
this game becomes
in the end.

987
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,419
That's my biggest
step to you.

988
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:12,679
Just do the exercises

989
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,860
each week and you should
be absolutely fine.

990
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,080
Okay, so that is the
second assignment.

991
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,019
I hope everyone is

992
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,279
feeling all right
about that.

993
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,459
I think it's quite fun.

994
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,159
It's definitely one of

995
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,740
the more interactive
assignments out there.

996
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,559
The nice thing is
you can actually

997
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,839
add this to your
portfolios from

998
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,759
the first
assignment if you

999
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,040
wanted to actually let

1000
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
employers see
your own work,

1001
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,899
which I quite like.

1002
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,079
You can even add this to

1003
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,199
an eye frame if
you wanted to.

1004
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,039
You might need to optimize
it a bit further,

1005
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,440
but that's

1006
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,060
just some standard
CSS properties here.

1007
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,519
I think Mark told me
very early on when I was

1008
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,879
a student that if
you're very passionate

1009
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:45,680
about an assignment,

1010
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
you tend to do quite well.

1011
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,900
In that the more excited

1012
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,219
you are about adding
things to this,

1013
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,819
about learning
parts to it,

1014
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:53,219
it tends to be the
better you'll do.

1015
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm quite a big gamer.
You can probably

1016
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,040
tell from all that
stuff over there.

1017
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,310
I'm really into this.
I love this stuff.

1018
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,749
It's probably the
assignment I was

1019
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:04,470
most passionate about
when I was a student.

1020
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,430
Hopefully some of you
feel the same way.

1021
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,269
Maybe this isn't
your capti at all.

1022
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,890
Maybe you really don't
like this stuff.

1023
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,030
That's absolutely fine.

1024
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,810
There will be modules
that you enjoy.

1025
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,729
This is going to be

1026
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,210
modules that you
don't enjoy.

1027
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,289
But I think finding
the passion

1028
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,689
in a lot of this stuff,
it's the way forward.

1029
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,329
Okay, nice thing is

1030
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:23,030
we're all starting
at the same point.

1031
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,569
I'm not going to
assume anyone's

1032
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:25,949
got any Javascript
knowledge.

1033
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,130
We're going to start
right from square one.

1034
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,490
Right from step one.

1035
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,770
Okay, that's the
second assignment.

1036
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,270
Yeah, good luck.
I'm going to start

1037
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,270
the first lecture
in just a second,

1038
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,570
but I'm going to pause

1039
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,689
this so I can then
edit it a little bit.

1040
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:43,249
Nicer. Yeah, I will see
you in just a second.

1041
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:46,150
Right, time for the
actual lecture for week.

1042
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,309
This week we
are focusing on

1043
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:51,129
an introduction
to Java Script.

1044
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,759
Javascript is

1045
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,579
the big part of the
second assignment.

1046
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,060
Hopefully you've
gathered that from

1047
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,020
the assignment breakdown

1048
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,320
we've just gone through.

1049
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,079
We're going to be
focusing on more

1050
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,560
of the basic elements,

1051
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,740
things like variables,
different functions,

1052
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,840
how we can debug
in the console,

1053
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,599
how we can actually

1054
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,919
select certain elements to

1055
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,819
the use in Javascript,
which is quite fun.

1056
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:13,920
The big one today

1057
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,939
is going to be
click events,

1058
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,020
and that's primarily
what we're

1059
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,240
going to be using
for the assignment.

1060
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,399
For

1061
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,600
those first two
requirements I spoke about,

1062
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,860
when we're clicking
on the Start

1063
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,259
button and it disappears.

1064
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,260
That's how we're going

1065
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,180
to be doing that today,

1066
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,380
which is quite exciting.

1067
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,849
Javascript, HTML
and CSS are

1068
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,550
used to present
information

1069
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,029
in very specific ways.

1070
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,929
We have our HTML elements,

1071
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,469
which is the data itself.

1072
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:38,910
We have the CSS, which

1073
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,749
is how that data looks.

1074
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,729
Now, the problem
is CSS and

1075
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:46,029
HTML have certain
limitations to them.

1076
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,609
For example,

1077
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,970
once that elements
on the screen,

1078
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,549
once that CSS has
been applied,

1079
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,929
there's not a
lot we can do.

1080
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:53,769
We don't have
as much control

1081
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,649
once it's on
the screen now.

1082
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:57,989
Yeah, we can do
some CSS selectors

1083
00:31:57,989 --> 00:31:59,289
like hover or target,

1084
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,149
which have very basic

1085
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:04,250
styling properties
to them.

1086
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,369
But the point is,

1087
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:06,670
once that elements
on the screen,

1088
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,429
we lose a lot of
that control,

1089
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:10,090
if that makes sense.

1090
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,469
The big takeaway
on this is HTML

1091
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:15,189
and CSS aren't
very interactive.

1092
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:17,090
We can display the page

1093
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,809
exactly how we like it.

1094
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,790
But once it's on the page,

1095
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,029
we can't do much
for interaction,

1096
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,789
if the user wants
to interact

1097
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:27,070
with certain parts
of that page.

1098
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,069
There's not a lot we can

1099
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:29,510
really do at that point.

1100
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,809
Okay, the nice thing
is, because of that,

1101
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,529
H CSS tend to be some of

1102
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:35,310
the more friendly
languages.

1103
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,029
I would say a few of you

1104
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,110
have really taken
a liking to HCSS,

1105
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,030
which is fantastic to see.

1106
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,029
Unfortunately, Javascript

1107
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,149
isn't quite the same.

1108
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,410
Html is a markup language,

1109
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,110
which basically means it's

1110
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,490
describing how that
data is structured.

1111
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,890
Remember HTML? It stands

1112
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,709
for Hypertext
Markup Language.

1113
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
What this really
boils down

1114
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,639
to is once that
code has been run,

1115
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,819
the browser interprets
that and then

1116
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:07,439
generates an output
based on that data.

1117
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,839
It goes from
top to bottom,

1118
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,565
line by line
in that order.

1119
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,670
Javascript, on
the other hand,

1120
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,489
is a programming language.

1121
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:18,549
This basically means we
have complete control

1122
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:21,209
over the order that that
program is executed.

1123
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,210
And it's typically not
in that structure.

1124
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,890
With HTML, it
goes from top

1125
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,030
to bottom, line by line.

1126
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,250
Javascript doesn't

1127
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,589
usually follow
that pattern.

1128
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:30,849
We might have a
bit of code at

1129
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:31,990
the bottom that
runs first,

1130
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,289
that then references
something in

1131
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,150
the middle which then
goes back to the top.

1132
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,889
It can even call
something in

1133
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,269
a completely separate
file entirely.

1134
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,610
The point is we need to
start thinking about

1135
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,989
our code running in
this different fashion.

1136
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,169
That's really what we're

1137
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:45,869
going to focus on with

1138
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:48,760
Javascript, if
that makes sense.

1139
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,510
Now, because we're
doing Javascript code,

1140
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,409
it needs to be
in its own file.

1141
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,030
There are ways of
doing this in HTML,

1142
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,550
but specifically
for the assignment,

1143
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,030
we're going to keep
our Javascript code

1144
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,790
in a Javascript file,

1145
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,630
just like CSS and HTML.

1146
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,950
Javascript goes in
Javascript file.

1147
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,449
Hopefully you can
see the screen.

1148
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,870
Chomsky is the
laser pointer,

1149
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,009
which I'm starting to use

1150
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,809
a lot more now,
which is fun.

1151
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:15,929
Our HTML ends with HTML.

1152
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,209
Our Javascript will
end up with Dos,

1153
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,010
and our CSS ends with SS.

1154
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,689
And each of them have

1155
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,224
their associated
icons to them.

1156
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:26,439
Now to run our
Javascript file in HTML,

1157
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,520
we need to use a new
element called script,

1158
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,800
a new HTML tag
called script.

1159
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,960
Now the script tag has
a source attribute,

1160
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,900
just like our image
tag that basically

1161
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,499
points to what that
HTML file is really,

1162
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:42,959
we're just, we're putting

1163
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:43,259
the name of

1164
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:46,140
our Javascript file
in that source.

1165
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,849
Now, our script
tags will go

1166
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:50,869
inside of the head
tags of our HTML.

1167
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,289
Now, there's been some
debate whether or

1168
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,070
not this should be in
the head or the body.

1169
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,490
But for modern browsers,

1170
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,190
the head is just a
bit more preferred.

1171
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,589
But again, there is
still a little bit

1172
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:00,489
of debate here or
there about that,

1173
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,549
to actually show you
what this looks like,

1174
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:04,709
here's a nice
illustration for you.

1175
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:07,410
It's our standard
HTML structure.

1176
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,449
We've got our doc type,

1177
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:10,209
our HTML tags on our head.

1178
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,089
But the new bit of

1179
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:12,989
code Redding is
this script tag.

1180
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:16,509
We say SRC equals
than the name of

1181
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,249
our Java script file and

1182
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,229
then we use the ending
script tag as well.

1183
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:21,829
We'll just put this in
the head along with

1184
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:25,510
our CSS. Doing
that together,

1185
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,840
we'll just create
a brand new index,

1186
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,579
page, index dot HTML.

1187
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,420
We'll do that very
nice shortcut.

1188
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,859
We'll then create
our script tag.

1189
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,179
Call this whatever
you want.

1190
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,160
I'm just going to
call it scripts,

1191
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
but the JS bits,
very important.

1192
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,320
We're then going to link
this into our HTML.

1193
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,579
Remember to use
Javascript,

1194
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,719
we need to link it to

1195
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,279
our HTML, use
the script tag.

1196
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:54,139
We're then going
to say scripts.

1197
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,939
We can do a little
check just to

1198
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:57,260
make sure that's been
linked over properly.

1199
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,099
The hover over this
and click Follow Link.

1200
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,539
If it opens up that file,

1201
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,499
we're all in the
clear, Which is nice.

1202
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:05,380
That's how we're linking
our Javascript page

1203
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,159
to our HTML.

1204
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,919
Okay, if you've
missed this step,

1205
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,639
unfortunately nothing's
going to work from

1206
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,759
this moment on just

1207
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,499
the way it is
unfortunately.

1208
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:17,379
But hopefully this
is quite clear.

1209
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,439
Now to check that

1210
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,040
our script is
loading correctly,

1211
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,579
we should probably
add some code to it.

1212
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,940
Let's create a function.

1213
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,640
Now, one of the pre
built functions

1214
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,560
in Java script is
called an alert.

1215
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,639
Now alert is essentially
a pop up box that

1216
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,779
appears in our
browser that

1217
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,479
has a piece of
text into it.

1218
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,619
In this case, we're

1219
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,859
saying alert
normal brackets.

1220
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,560
Then in single
quotation marks,

1221
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,940
we're putting a
piece of text.

1222
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,569
We also end this
with a semicolon.

1223
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:53,100
Using this in our
Java script file.

1224
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,020
Using this in scripts,

1225
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,039
we get something that
looks like this.

1226
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,639
Now again, this is

1227
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,139
dependent on the
browser you're on.

1228
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:01,519
Sometimes it looks a
little bit different

1229
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,239
if you're on
Firefox or Edge,

1230
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,059
or really anything else.

1231
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,439
But this is what an
alert does in our HTML.

1232
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,879
I'm just going
to add a very

1233
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,159
basic heading tag because
we're going to use

1234
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,619
a little bit
later on we'll

1235
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:16,299
just add a tag as well,

1236
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:19,399
maybe with just
some laurumext.

1237
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,759
We'll just make
sure this is

1238
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:23,800
loading in correctly.

1239
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,569
There we've got our
heading and our tag.

1240
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:30,309
If I want to make sure

1241
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:32,050
my Javascript file is
connected properly,

1242
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,569
I can use no
alerts in this.

1243
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:38,370
I could just say page

1244
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,850
working with a couple
of explanation marks

1245
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,310
if this is all
linking up correctly.

1246
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,109
If I click refresh, we

1247
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:48,129
get the alert box pop
up just here that says,

1248
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,410
this page says page

1249
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,610
working and
clicking, okay.

1250
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,969
But I'm not sure

1251
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,609
how many people
have noticed this.

1252
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:57,689
But something a bit
weird happened there.

1253
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:01,010
Can you see that
this alert happens?

1254
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,029
And then our content
is interesting, right?

1255
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,829
Put a pin in it,
we'll get back to it.

1256
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,205
Essentially, our
pop up appears,

1257
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:15,340
the contents of that HTML

1258
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,740
aren't immediately loaded.

1259
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,600
The second we click okay,

1260
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,940
then our elements
are loaded.

1261
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,560
That's because
Java script runs

1262
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
before those HTML elements

1263
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,800
are drawn on the screen.

1264
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,499
If you look at
the file order,

1265
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:30,340
we link our script tags.

1266
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,959
So our script
tag runs first,

1267
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,640
our Javascript runs first,

1268
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,239
and then our HTML content

1269
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,579
runs. Interesting, right?

1270
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,320
That's why when we refresh

1271
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,400
the page, look
at the alert,

1272
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
We blank screen,
we click okay,

1273
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,819
and then our content
exists. Pretty cool.

1274
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,109
A couple of uses
for Javascript.

1275
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,169
Essentially,
Javascript is used

1276
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,610
to control HTML
elements on our page.

1277
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,709
We can assign certain
pieces of CSS to them.

1278
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,470
We could add or remove

1279
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,030
HTML attributes entirely.

1280
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,509
So we've got a HTML form,

1281
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:07,229
we can actually get

1282
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:08,930
the inputs from
those forms.

1283
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,090
For your contact pages
where you're typing

1284
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,189
in the name and maybe
a message for e mail,

1285
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:15,250
we can actually
get those values

1286
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,449
and do something
with them.

1287
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:20,009
We can detect when
certain keys are

1288
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:22,630
impressed In that
Javascript assignment game,

1289
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,249
the Pac Man based one,

1290
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:25,329
we're detecting when

1291
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,690
the error keys
are impressed.

1292
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,010
But we can do that
with virtually

1293
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,690
any key on our keyboard.

1294
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,609
Not only that, we can even

1295
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:32,630
check when elements

1296
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,809
are being interacted with.

1297
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:35,870
If our mouse
curse is hovering

1298
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,010
over a certain section,
we can do something.

1299
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,530
If we've clicked
on an element,

1300
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,949
we can do something else.

1301
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:44,049
Javascript has a ton of
different uses to it,

1302
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,669
but the real key one is it

1303
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:48,150
adds interactivity
to those pages.

1304
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,350
It allows us to control

1305
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,589
when something happens
and more specifically,

1306
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,390
what happens during
that process.

1307
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,249
If that makes
sense, we get to

1308
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:01,310
control when that
happens. Basically

1309
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,559
bodies, I've got
a sore throat.

1310
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,839
It's not very fun.

1311
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,680
So one of the pinnacle,

1312
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,120
the major concepts
in programming

1313
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,999
is something that
we call variables.

1314
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,920
We look very briefly
at variables in CSS,

1315
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,599
but variables go a

1316
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:23,139
step further
in Javascript.

1317
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:26,779
Now, a variable, in its
very most basic form,

1318
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:30,560
is a way of us to give
a label to a value.

1319
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,760
The idea is when we
want to use that value,

1320
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,699
we can call that label
if that makes sense.

1321
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,660
In this sense,
we could create

1322
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,920
a label called name.

1323
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,919
That name, label would

1324
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,099
link to an actual name

1325
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,159
that someone's type it in.

1326
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,139
Or we could create
a number label and

1327
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:49,480
that number
equals ten or 20.

1328
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,329
It's a bit weird to

1329
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,389
initially get
your head around,

1330
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:53,829
but essentially a
variable is way

1331
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,789
for us to call
something by a name.

1332
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,189
We can then use
that name to

1333
00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:00,109
reference that value,
if that makes sense.

1334
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:02,009
Now in Javascript, we have

1335
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:03,470
a lot of control over
these variables.

1336
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,109
We can really call
it any name we like.

1337
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,949
It's chosen by us,
not Javascript.

1338
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,630
The value of that variable

1339
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,909
is chosen by us as well.

1340
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:13,329
We could say name
equals Chris,

1341
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,714
or number equals ten.

1342
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:19,119
The only bit that we
need to absolutely

1343
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,780
has to be in is the type

1344
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,399
of variable we're using.

1345
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,759
There are two types of

1346
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:25,260
variable in Java scripts.

1347
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,920
There's let and constant.

1348
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,639
And they both do very
different things.

1349
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,579
It's quite important not

1350
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,020
to get them confused.

1351
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,500
Now, let is probably one
of the more commonly

1352
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,560
used of the two variables

1353
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,939
to declare a
variable using let.

1354
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:42,440
We start with
the keyword let,

1355
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,279
go figure it's let,

1356
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:46,459
followed by the
name of the

1357
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:47,679
variable we'd
like to give it.

1358
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,819
In this case, I'm being

1359
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:49,999
quite boring
and calling it

1360
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:53,180
variable name
equals this value.

1361
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,399
When I call variable name,

1362
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:59,099
it will equal value,
if that makes sense.

1363
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,239
Now it's very important to

1364
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,919
realize the name
of the variable is

1365
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:05,059
chosen by you
and the value of

1366
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,220
the variable is chosen

1367
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,844
by the only bits
that are required by

1368
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:12,089
are the let part
and the equal sign.

1369
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:14,129
Also obviously these
quotation marks as well.

1370
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:15,249
That's a little
bit important as

1371
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:18,629
well. But that's it.

1372
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:19,950
We have quite a
lot of control

1373
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,629
over what this
variable is.

1374
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:23,509
Now the big
cool thing with

1375
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,910
let is we can reassign
that variable,

1376
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,489
which means that
variable can have

1377
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:29,570
multiple values at
different points.

1378
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,629
For example, when we

1379
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:31,650
first start this program,

1380
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,250
we've initialized this
variable called value.

1381
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,989
We could then change
it to this now,

1382
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,829
then changed
again and again.

1383
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:42,710
The idea is we can
change this value

1384
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,590
over and over again,
which is interesting.

1385
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,109
For example, we could have

1386
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:48,529
a variable called age.

1387
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:50,249
And that age will
progressively get

1388
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:51,609
bigger and bigger as each

1389
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:53,389
year or day goes by.

1390
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:55,830
The idea is with
a let variable,

1391
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,249
we can reassign it,

1392
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,090
we can reassign that value

1393
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,929
over and over again,

1394
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:04,029
doing one of these
variables ourselves. Then

1395
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,779
I could say a equals ten.

1396
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:12,319
I just realized
my age isn't ten.

1397
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,619
Let's change this to
25 my actual age.

1398
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:19,919
We could also say
number equals one,

1399
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,939
but then we
realize number one

1400
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:23,080
sounds a bit boring.

1401
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,399
Let's say number
equals five.

1402
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,299
We can even do, we
can do text as well,

1403
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:35,799
so we could well
be a good one.

1404
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:39,959
My name Chris.

1405
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,659
But we can then
change by name to

1406
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:45,400
equals something like
Mark for instance.

1407
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,439
That's really the
big thing with

1408
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:48,640
these let variables.

1409
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,200
We can change the value

1410
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,799
further down the line
that we want to.

1411
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:53,619
We can use the same
variable name,

1412
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,579
change the value if
that makes sense.

1413
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,039
Again, we're not
limited to one or two.

1414
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,659
We can do this as many
times as we want,

1415
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:04,979
like this, that makes
a little bit of

1416
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,339
sense because that's
going to tie in

1417
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:07,579
quite heavily
into the next bit

1418
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:08,899
we're about to do.

1419
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:12,459
If we can reassign
variables using let,

1420
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:15,335
what is constant exactly?

1421
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:16,909
Well, the second type of

1422
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:18,150
variable is
called constant,

1423
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,010
and that stands
for constant.

1424
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,890
Now again, it's
a very similar

1425
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,509
process to when
we use let,

1426
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:24,989
except the big change on

1427
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:26,689
this one is instead
of saying let,

1428
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:28,170
we're using the
word constant.

1429
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,110
Now the big
fundamental difference

1430
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,130
between let and
constant is constant.

1431
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,089
Variables cannot
be reassigned

1432
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,550
once we've set that value,

1433
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,629
once we've set
variable name to

1434
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:41,249
that value, that's it.

1435
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:43,109
If we were to try
changing this,

1436
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:44,369
we'd get an error.

1437
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:45,629
It's very good when you

1438
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:46,929
want something to
stay the same.

1439
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:48,210
For example, if
we're finding

1440
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,729
a tag in our HTML and

1441
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:50,929
we know that
the main tag is

1442
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:51,649
never going to change,

1443
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:52,869
it's always going
to be this.

1444
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:54,290
That would be a
good opportunity

1445
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,930
to use a constant variable

1446
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,569
in the assignment in
the Javascript game,

1447
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:00,669
The player where I

1448
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:02,290
found the player
character,

1449
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,170
that's using a
constant variable

1450
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:04,809
because the player is

1451
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:06,609
always going to
stay the same.

1452
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:08,129
In this case, when we know

1453
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:09,649
something is going
to stay the same,

1454
00:45:09,649 --> 00:45:11,730
constant is quite
a good variable

1455
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,880
to use. Okay,

1456
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,369
one thing I'll
mention is var.

1457
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:18,510
Var was the older way
of doing variables.

1458
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,429
Back in the day,
Javascript had

1459
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:21,529
a big change and we no

1460
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:23,330
longer really use anymore.

1461
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,110
But essentially
it functions

1462
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,409
very similarly to let.

1463
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:28,010
The idea is we
can reassign

1464
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,369
it time and time again.

1465
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:31,689
If you do see an
example using,

1466
00:45:31,689 --> 00:45:33,149
you're probably looking at

1467
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,550
quite an old
piece of code.

1468
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,949
Typically we only use V

1469
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:37,649
now for legacy pieces of

1470
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:39,490
code or very old browsers

1471
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,889
that haven't quite
caught up with let cons.

1472
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:43,989
The areas that included
this slide is just

1473
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:45,810
in case you do see
some examples online.

1474
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,610
But primarily the
way we do variables

1475
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,490
now is using
let and const.

1476
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,809
If you're a bit unsure
about which ones

1477
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:55,990
to use in general,

1478
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,330
you shouldn't be using
bar again and const.

1479
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,109
Think they were
introduced back in 2015.

1480
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:03,329
It's almost been ten years

1481
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:05,129
since we've been
using these.

1482
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,489
You shouldn't
be using bar,

1483
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:07,729
you should be
using let and

1484
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:11,390
const if you ever need
to change that value.

1485
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,990
If you know that value

1486
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,089
is going to stay
exactly the

1487
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:17,610
same from now to the
dawn of time. Use const.

1488
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,310
In my opinion, I
think let is probably

1489
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,389
a bit more commonly
used because again,

1490
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,009
typically we are going
to be reassigning

1491
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:25,850
values to variables,

1492
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,970
especially with our
Java script games.

1493
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,810
You ever a little
bit unsure,

1494
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,284
just use let. Okay,

1495
00:46:32,284 --> 00:46:34,880
Black said use constant.

1496
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,939
It's always going
to stay the

1497
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:37,819
same if that makes sense.

1498
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:39,399
So we'll just use

1499
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:40,819
a constant
variable to serve.

1500
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:42,620
Everyone is on
the same page.

1501
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,979
So if I said const,
let's go with,

1502
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:54,619
well, that would be a
good const. Let's say

1503
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,899
we'll dude name because

1504
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:01,780
name looks like one const,

1505
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,039
my name equals Chris.

1506
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,059
If I want to try
and reassign this,

1507
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,859
if I said my name
equals mark,

1508
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:14,839
this would
immediately throw

1509
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:16,460
up an error in
the browser.

1510
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,400
Let's see it in action.

1511
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,760
Big error, just the
assignment to constant

1512
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,959
variable on line eight,
which is this one.

1513
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,299
When we use
const, we can't

1514
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:30,359
reassign it if
that makes sense.

1515
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,239
Again, constant is
very good when we know

1516
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,279
our name is never going

1517
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:34,659
to change in this case,

1518
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:38,960
okay? Now when dealing
with variables,

1519
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,620
we have two different
types of variable.

1520
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,199
We've got a number and

1521
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:45,120
a string, which is text.

1522
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,480
These are our two data
types in Java script.

1523
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,439
Now, the way
we assign this

1524
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:53,969
is how we use it that way.

1525
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:56,359
If we're doing a number
like we've done with

1526
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:58,960
the age property, with
the name variable.

1527
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,639
Thinking in CSS, all

1528
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:02,040
we need to do
is say equals,

1529
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,340
then a number with
no quotation marks.

1530
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,819
Let number equals ten.

1531
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,559
This variable
data type is now

1532
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,960
a number to
assign A string.

1533
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,399
Again, strings are
just pieces of text.

1534
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:14,780
We use quotation marks,

1535
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,500
and then we put
our text inside

1536
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,700
those quotation marks.

1537
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,119
The way we declare what

1538
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,919
data type these
variables are,

1539
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:23,720
are how we use
these variables,

1540
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,579
if that makes sense.

1541
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,649
Now putting this into more

1542
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:28,989
of like an English
translation,

1543
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,549
our code can
be interpreted

1544
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:31,850
as create a variable

1545
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,549
called the equal sign

1546
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:35,589
can then be read
as set two.

1547
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:37,090
In these two examples,

1548
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,389
let's focus on
the number one.

1549
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:40,490
To start with, we're
essentially creating

1550
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,730
a variable called number

1551
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,329
and setting it to ten.

1552
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:47,084
Create our number variable
and set it to ten.

1553
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:48,839
It's the exact same thing

1554
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:49,760
with the second example.

1555
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,859
We're creating a
variable called string,

1556
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:54,859
let string equals and

1557
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:57,800
set that string
variable to text.

1558
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,139
I think sometimes,
especially when it's

1559
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:00,719
your first time

1560
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:02,480
doing these
programming languages,

1561
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,859
hopefully everyone's
got a little bit

1562
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:04,639
of knowledge on this

1563
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,040
now from the
Python module,

1564
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,059
but if not, that's fine.

1565
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,459
Trying to get

1566
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:12,239
your own definitions
in your head

1567
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,779
for what's going on

1568
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:16,180
really does help with
a lot of this stuff.

1569
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,539
For example, some
terminology people use

1570
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,639
can go completely over
other people's heads.

1571
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,139
Talking about

1572
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:22,520
the software
engineering module,

1573
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,299
we're really focused
on terminology

1574
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:26,480
and jargon in
those interviews.

1575
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,979
Again, if I were to

1576
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:31,459
teach you using very
complex terminology,

1577
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:32,779
a lot of you probably
wouldn't get

1578
00:49:32,779 --> 00:49:34,719
it because it's your
first time doing this.

1579
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,340
If you find it
a lot easier,

1580
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,159
thinking about

1581
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:38,519
creating variables
in this manner.

1582
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,939
So create a variable
call and set it to that.

1583
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,160
Say it out loud sometimes.

1584
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,880
One of my first web
loper lecturers,

1585
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,599
she actually brought in

1586
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:47,519
a bunch of rubber ducks.

1587
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,039
Once there's a
very common way

1588
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:51,580
of debugging your code,

1589
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,960
it's called
rubber ducking,

1590
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,259
I think I want to
say that's the name.

1591
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,319
But essentially you talk

1592
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,799
about the problem
to something.

1593
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:59,540
Usually it's an
inanimate object,

1594
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,019
like a rubber duck.

1595
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:03,639
Typically, by
talking through

1596
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,859
your issue or talking
through your problem,

1597
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:07,579
nine times out
of ten, you'll

1598
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:08,919
come up with the
solution to it.

1599
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,259
It's a very strange way

1600
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:12,119
of doing things,
but it does work.

1601
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:13,839
If you have to say it out

1602
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,259
loud for it to make
sense, just do it.

1603
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:16,339
No one's going to judge.

1604
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:18,085
Well, I won't. Anyway,

1605
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:19,890
the lastly variables.

1606
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,989
So we've got two
different types.

1607
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,610
We've got number and
we've got strings.

1608
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,229
At this stage we do
have a few more,

1609
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,150
but we're going
to introduce

1610
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,550
them as the
weeks progress,

1611
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,069
But just for now, we're
going to focus on

1612
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:30,889
number and string. Okay.

1613
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:33,430
Now, how do we actually
use these variables?

1614
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,810
Well, once I've got
the variable created,

1615
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,869
we can reference it
wherever we like.

1616
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,989
In our case, we're

1617
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:43,010
creating a variable
called alert text.

1618
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,009
We're then setting it

1619
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,390
to the value of
script loaded.

1620
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,850
This value is
this variable,

1621
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,030
essentially a variable
is this value.

1622
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,850
If I want to use
this variable,

1623
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,709
you just put it where we

1624
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:57,410
would typically
put that value.

1625
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,370
In our case, when we
say alert, alert,

1626
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,669
it will give me
the value of

1627
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:05,729
that variable.
Cool, right?

1628
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,160
Let's try it.
If I said alert

1629
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,239
and let's say my name
inside this alert box,

1630
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,979
it should say
Chris, like this.

1631
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:21,159
Instead of me having
to type in Chris,

1632
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:22,400
I'm using that variable.

1633
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,939
I could do

1634
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:24,099
the exact same thing
with the number.

1635
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:27,980
I could put age on this,
which would say 25.

1636
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,859
Good thing is I
can even do quite

1637
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:32,919
a few alerts I want to,

1638
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:36,179
I could say at my name.

1639
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:37,200
And we'll get two alerts

1640
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,919
pop up, which
is quite fun.

1641
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:40,580
That's get a bit annoying.

1642
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,879
After a few though,

1643
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:45,699
we've got Chris and
then 25 pretty fun.

1644
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,260
That's essentially how
we can use variables.

1645
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,119
We just use the name
of the variable and

1646
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,620
it points in the direction
of these values,

1647
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:58,499
which is fun. Anything in

1648
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,200
these quotation marks
is treated as a string.

1649
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,579
I think outside of

1650
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,940
these quotation
marks is data.

1651
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,759
A very common programming
mistake is not

1652
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:11,580
really understanding

1653
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,399
the difference between the

1654
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:14,859
two when we put things in.

1655
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:17,619
Typically
Javascript is going

1656
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:18,759
to identify that as the

1657
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:20,259
start point of a string.

1658
00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:22,519
It's the starting point
of the piece of text.

1659
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:24,319
The next quotation mark is

1660
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,400
the ending piece
of that text.

1661
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,959
I think that's not inside
those quotes data,

1662
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:31,819
it's a command that

1663
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:33,699
Javascript will
do something with

1664
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,419
whether it's an
equal sign or

1665
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:38,280
the let or the actual
name of the variable.

1666
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,109
Essentially, the first
quote is the start,

1667
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:43,529
the second quote
is the end.

1668
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:45,990
And anything inside
those quotes is data.

1669
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,569
Really get familiar with

1670
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:49,170
looking at these colors.

1671
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,810
Again, going back
to visual studio,

1672
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,149
these colors will
always be the

1673
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:53,710
same in the default theme.

1674
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,789
Anyway, our variables are

1675
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:57,970
typically in these
blue colors.

1676
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,809
Constant is a
slightly darker blue,

1677
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:00,909
but it's still that blue.

1678
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:03,915
Any major command
is white.

1679
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,719
Functions are typically
in a yellow form.

1680
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,480
In a yellow color,
for example,

1681
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,940
these alerts are yellow.

1682
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,139
Get familiar with
seeing these.

1683
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:13,439
If I were to, let's

1684
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:14,860
say miss a bracket
for instance,

1685
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,899
Immediately
this turns red.

1686
00:53:16,899 --> 00:53:19,119
I think in red
is an error.

1687
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,680
So they get very familiar

1688
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,459
with seeing where
these mistakes are.

1689
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:23,880
Look at the color
combinations.

1690
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,039
If something
doesn't look right,

1691
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,379
it's probably not right.

1692
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:29,719
If I've accidentally
left a quote open here,

1693
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,359
here again, things
don't look right.

1694
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:36,639
I've got a red
line under let,

1695
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,139
and I've got my semi
colon in red as well.

1696
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:39,939
Again,

1697
00:53:39,939 --> 00:53:41,580
get familiar with
looking at these colors.

1698
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,025
They are very useful.

1699
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:48,690
Okay, just
really remember,

1700
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,129
I think in quotes is

1701
00:53:50,129 --> 00:53:51,730
data that's going
to be processed,

1702
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,330
and I think not in
quotes is a command.

1703
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,069
It's important to

1704
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,689
understand the difference
between the two.

1705
00:53:57,689 --> 00:53:58,930
It's a very common problem

1706
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,209
that a lot of
people do face,

1707
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:02,190
especially when they
first do Java script.

1708
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,770
If you forget
the quotation

1709
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,149
marks, it won't work.

1710
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:07,729
If you've accidentally
got too many

1711
00:54:07,729 --> 00:54:09,669
quotation marks,
it won't work.

1712
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:11,010
Again, just get familiar

1713
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,410
with looking at
that structure.

1714
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,529
It's going to look very

1715
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:15,449
strange the first
time you see it,

1716
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:17,129
but the more you do it,

1717
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,269
the easier it does get.

1718
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:19,209
That's generally the rule

1719
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:21,410
with most of programming.

1720
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,159
I went too far.
Now, each of

1721
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:26,219
these statements ends
with a semicolon.

1722
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:27,780
The semicolon
is essentially

1723
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,780
the end of the statement.

1724
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,300
It's a bit like a
full stop in English,

1725
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,879
we're basically
saying this is

1726
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:34,360
the end of that statement,

1727
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,419
you missed the semicolon.

1728
00:54:36,419 --> 00:54:40,060
Again, typically things
don't work, okay?

1729
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,559
Just make sure
the semicolons

1730
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:42,319
are in there as well.

1731
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,075
It's a bit more finicky
than H two CSS.

1732
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,690
Now, the actual
Javascript syntax,

1733
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,830
even the slightest hypo,

1734
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,810
will stop everything
from working.

1735
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,689
Spelling massively
matters if

1736
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:57,589
you've spell a
variable incorrectly.

1737
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:59,710
Again, everything works.

1738
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,570
Javascript is
case sensitive,

1739
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,989
which means capital
letters are

1740
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:05,190
treated differently than
lower case letters.

1741
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,510
If you've called
a variable

1742
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,969
with upper case letter,

1743
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:09,390
you need to
keep on calling

1744
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,269
it with that upper
case letter.

1745
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,829
If you miss a
bracket, semicolon,

1746
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:16,570
adopt any very
small mistake

1747
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,045
will prevent everything
from working.

1748
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:21,260
You will make
these mistakes.

1749
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,180
It's just the way
Dravascript works.

1750
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,220
When you make
mistakes, don't panic.

1751
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,819
Usually it's a
very small thing

1752
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:28,739
that you can fix.

1753
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:30,139
I guarantee most of you

1754
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,739
will come into the
issue today of whether

1755
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:33,239
it's a quotation mark

1756
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:35,159
or a bracket or
a semicolon.

1757
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:36,619
Just get used
to looking for

1758
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:37,899
those red errors
because again,

1759
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,259
typically wherever
it's red,

1760
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:41,279
that's usually where
the mistake is.

1761
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:43,439
Identify where that
mistake is and

1762
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:45,380
try fixing it, okay?

1763
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,140
Get used to looking for
the smallest mistake.

1764
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,879
Like I said, the
tiniest thing you've

1765
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,160
missed will completely
change everything

1766
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,509
back to variables.
Then you can

1767
00:55:56,509 --> 00:55:58,289
create as many
variables as you like.

1768
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,850
Once a variable
has been created,

1769
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,250
we can perform a variety

1770
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,589
of different
operations on it.

1771
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:04,409
For our number variables,
we can actually do

1772
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:06,549
different mathematical
operations to it.

1773
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:08,550
For example, we
could do addition,

1774
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,330
subtraction,
multiplication,

1775
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,149
division, very fun stuff.

1776
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:12,869
In this case, we've

1777
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,310
created two
number variables.

1778
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,589
Number one is five and
number two is ten.

1779
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:18,029
We're then
creating a third

1780
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:19,290
variable called total,

1781
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,709
which equals number
one plus number two,

1782
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:23,470
which is obviously 15.

1783
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,969
We're then
printing out the

1784
00:56:24,969 --> 00:56:26,170
total in this alert,

1785
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,710
which is why in this
alert box it says 15.

1786
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,889
We could even do that

1787
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,329
directly in the alert
if we wanted to do,

1788
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:32,469
we wouldn't
necessarily have to do

1789
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:35,249
variables if I wanted
to, I could say

1790
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:42,090
100 plus ten in the alert,

1791
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:44,389
it would say 110.

1792
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:46,509
We could do very
complex math where I

1793
00:56:46,509 --> 00:56:48,530
could start using these
ages and numbers.

1794
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:53,730
Up here, I could say
minus age times number.

1795
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,089
For instance, again we're

1796
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:59,050
combining actual values
with these variables.

1797
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,829
Now I've got negative
15, which is fun.

1798
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:03,429
The point is we can do

1799
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:06,049
some very complex
expressions

1800
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:07,610
in this using
these variables,

1801
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,575
which is quite exciting.

1802
00:57:09,575 --> 00:57:12,639
I feel like I've thrown
quite a lot at you.

1803
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,100
Let's maybe go into an
exercise very briefly.

1804
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,020
I want you to create

1805
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,780
a very basic web
page with HTML.

1806
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,300
Again, have
your HTML tags,

1807
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,640
the body and the head tags

1808
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,959
inside your body tag have

1809
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:27,599
a H one tag and a tag

1810
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,159
that contain any
text you like.

1811
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,039
This will come into

1812
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:31,240
play in the next exercise.

1813
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,359
Later on, add a script tag

1814
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:35,879
to that page that

1815
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:38,259
references a file
called script.

1816
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:39,959
Exactly like we've done in

1817
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:41,900
the previous examples.

1818
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,219
Again,

1819
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,019
you're pretty much going

1820
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:43,759
to create something like

1821
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:47,499
this with this
script tag. Okay?

1822
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,939
Inside that script tag,

1823
00:57:49,939 --> 00:57:51,520
add an alert command,

1824
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,079
change it to whatever
text you like.

1825
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,979
Open that HTML
file and just

1826
00:57:56,979 --> 00:57:58,380
make sure it's in
the same directory

1827
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,059
as your Java script file.

1828
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,999
Once you've
checked that it is

1829
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:04,060
open that HTML
in your browser,

1830
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,220
and check that alert
box is being shown.

1831
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,980
If you don't
have that alert,

1832
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,159
there's a good chance that

1833
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,479
something's gone
wrong here.

1834
00:58:10,479 --> 00:58:12,839
Maybe you've mistyped
the file name

1835
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:14,059
or you haven't got

1836
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:15,379
the alert command
in there.

1837
00:58:15,379 --> 00:58:16,659
Again, make
sure you've got

1838
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,099
the alert popping up.

1839
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,879
Okay, Make sure you've

1840
00:58:19,879 --> 00:58:22,360
got this popping
up, basically.

1841
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,659
For exercise two, I want

1842
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:27,360
you to create two
number variables.

1843
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,060
One that equals 10.1,
that equals 15.

1844
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,440
And try out a
few different

1845
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,959
mathematical
operations to them.

1846
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:36,339
Try out addition,
multiplication,

1847
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:37,559
division, and then

1848
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,559
this strange
percentage one.

1849
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,799
I'm not going to go
over this just yet,

1850
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:43,399
but this isn't
quite what you

1851
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:45,959
think is it's a very
interesting one.

1852
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:48,779
But try different
mathematical

1853
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:49,900
operations on
these variables.

1854
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,239
Again, this is your
opportunity to get

1855
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,280
familiar with
creating variables,

1856
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,365
using them with the
alert function.

1857
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,209
Hey, maybe even
try some of

1858
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,330
these operations
on strings.

1859
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,990
What happens if you
add two strings

1860
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,909
together? Have a go.

1861
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:05,310
This is quite a nice
introduction exercise

1862
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,849
just to ease you
into Javascript.

1863
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:09,870
Maybe take ten or 20
minutes on this, okay?

1864
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,529
And then we're going
to come back to

1865
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:14,570
some more fun basic
Javascript stuff.

1866
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,369
Pause the video, have

1867
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:18,469
a go at it, and then
we'll come back.

1868
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:21,029
Okay, Right,
and we're back.

1869
00:59:21,029 --> 00:59:22,509
Hopefully you've
got to go at

1870
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:24,360
creating some variables.

1871
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,089
The next big thing
we're going to

1872
00:59:26,089 --> 00:59:27,450
look at is functions.

1873
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,689
Functions are labels that

1874
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:31,490
we can give to big
blocks of code.

1875
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,450
Essentially,
it's stores code

1876
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:35,609
that we can then
use later on.

1877
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:38,229
The idea is we can
give it a name.

1878
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:40,429
If we call that name,
it's then going to

1879
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:42,589
run that piece of code,
if that makes sense.

1880
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:43,949
This is fundamentally
how we're

1881
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,950
going to write our
code out of sequence.

1882
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,649
Breaking this down
a little bit,

1883
00:59:47,649 --> 00:59:50,829
we have the function
keyword again.

1884
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:52,769
Typically it's in the
darker blue color.

1885
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:54,610
We then have the
name of the function

1886
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:56,570
followed by two
regular brackets

1887
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,669
that that bit is quite

1888
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:01,169
crucial if you
missed that bit.

1889
01:00:01,169 --> 01:00:03,969
Unfortunately
it won't work.

1890
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:06,769
Now the function name
is chosen by you,

1891
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,430
so it can be
absolutely anything.

1892
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,309
But again, try keeping
these quite simple.

1893
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:11,449
Quite short if you can,

1894
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:12,569
the longer the
function name,

1895
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:14,789
the more you have to
type out each time.

1896
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:18,210
Calling it something
simple is quite useful.

1897
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,570
We've got the two
regular brackets,

1898
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:20,969
and then we have

1899
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:22,569
our two curly
braces in here,

1900
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:24,290
just like we do
with the CSS.

1901
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,750
We then have the code

1902
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,610
inside of this function.

1903
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:29,750
In our case, we're
saying function addition

1904
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,669
with our addition
code in there.

1905
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,550
Let's try and replicate
that ourselves.

1906
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,320
So we're going
to say function,

1907
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,799
I'll just call this
ad because, why not?

1908
01:00:41,799 --> 01:00:43,179
I think ad might be

1909
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:45,460
a predefined
one, possibly.

1910
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,439
Or hopefully it's not.

1911
01:00:46,439 --> 01:00:47,679
Yeah, we'll just say Ad.

1912
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,619
Why not Call me lazy.

1913
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,019
I don't like typing a
division each time.

1914
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:56,899
We'll say number
one equals five.

1915
01:00:56,899 --> 01:01:05,840
Number two equals
ten total.

1916
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,369
Yeah, that is
smells total is

1917
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:12,209
number one plus
number two.

1918
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:16,850
Then we'll say
alert total.

1919
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:20,369
Okay? Nothing too
crazy just yet.

1920
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:21,429
That is how we're going to

1921
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:22,670
create our first function.

1922
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,129
This function
is called ad.

1923
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:25,630
And inside this
Ad function

1924
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,550
is this very basic
addition code.

1925
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,629
It's going to add number
one and number two

1926
01:01:29,629 --> 01:01:31,009
together and then print

1927
01:01:31,009 --> 01:01:33,649
out the total in
this alert box.

1928
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,900
Now, when code is stored
inside the function,

1929
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,799
it's not executed
immediately.

1930
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:42,519
You might think
this code will run,

1931
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,799
but actually what
happens is nothing.

1932
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,280
If I take this out
of the function,

1933
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,660
so if I remove the
function entirely,

1934
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,739
that alert box
will pop up.

1935
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:57,060
But if I put that function

1936
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,580
back, nothing
actually happens.

1937
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,530
That's because once we've
created a function,

1938
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,010
once we've defined
a function,

1939
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,010
we also need to
call that function.

1940
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,530
Now the way we
call a function

1941
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,229
is by using the
function name

1942
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:16,029
followed by two regular
brackets, like this.

1943
01:02:16,029 --> 01:02:18,110
To run our
addition function,

1944
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,249
we just need to
call it, just

1945
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:21,810
call it somewhere
in our document.

1946
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,690
This allows us to create

1947
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,789
our code out of
sequence, essentially.

1948
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:28,269
Now normally code gets

1949
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:29,810
run in the order
it's written,

1950
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,869
but using functions
allows us

1951
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:34,329
to run code in whatever
order we like.

1952
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:36,890
In our case, we're
creating this function,

1953
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,829
it's not being
called immediately,

1954
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:41,410
we're then calling
that function.

1955
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,369
If we try calling ad,

1956
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:47,869
we'll do it down
here. We'll say add.

1957
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:51,730
It will then run
our ad function

1958
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,390
which has those two
numbers being added

1959
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,729
together and then
printed out into

1960
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,869
our alert box.
Cool, right?

1961
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,730
We can put code
into a function.

1962
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,249
It won't get called
immediately,

1963
01:03:01,249 --> 01:03:03,289
it will only get
called when we call

1964
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:07,269
that function name
instead of fun.

1965
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,209
Now, functions are a bit

1966
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:11,710
like a program
on our computer.

1967
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,209
Creating a function is

1968
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:15,350
like installing
that program.

1969
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:17,350
It's there on
our computer,

1970
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,929
but it won't do anything
until we run it.

1971
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:20,890
Essentially,

1972
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,970
that Java script
interpreter, our browser,

1973
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,390
will ignore the
code inside

1974
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,330
the function until we
call that function.

1975
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,970
If you've created
a function

1976
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,469
but you never call it,

1977
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:32,589
that function will
never be run.

1978
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:34,730
That code will never
be run by the browser.

1979
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,990
If you create
the function,

1980
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,249
make sure you're
calling it when

1981
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:39,449
you need it, okay?

1982
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,269
Now purposes of
functions at

1983
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:47,949
this stage are we can

1984
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,790
massively reduce
repeated code.

1985
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,949
Instead of doing
the same piece of

1986
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:54,449
code over and over
and over again.

1987
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:55,609
What we could do is put

1988
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:56,770
that code into a function

1989
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,589
and then just call

1990
01:03:57,589 --> 01:04:00,175
that function
multiple times.

1991
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,399
In this case, I've

1992
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:04,259
got my adding
code right here.

1993
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:06,400
I'm creating these
same variables

1994
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,899
multiple times, 123.

1995
01:04:09,899 --> 01:04:11,719
I'm creating four of

1996
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:14,279
these blocks of code
multiple times.

1997
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:15,899
So as the laser point is,

1998
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,720
each block of this code

1999
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,059
is happening four times.

2000
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,019
That's quite a
lot of code.

2001
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:24,180
Or I could put it
into a function,

2002
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,180
in this case we're saying
function addition,

2003
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,799
then we're calling
it four times.

2004
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:30,540
Instead, it's
massively reducing

2005
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,960
the duplication
of our code.

2006
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,850
They both produce
exactly the same output,

2007
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,140
but one of them is a
bit more efficient.

2008
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,639
The fun thing is
we're actually going

2009
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:39,680
to focus on massively

2010
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,320
improving this in
further weeks.

2011
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,359
You might be able
to see we are still

2012
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,119
doing the same thing
over and over again.

2013
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,959
We might be able to
loop through it,

2014
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:50,979
a little bit of a hint

2015
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:52,719
for a couple
of weeks time.

2016
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,960
But the point is we
can use functions

2017
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,260
to massively reduce
our amount of code.

2018
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,079
Again, we go from
this to this.

2019
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,400
This is a lot tighter
and it's a lot neater,

2020
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,259
it's a lot easier to

2021
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:05,079
see what's going on here.

2022
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:08,419
Hopefully that makes
sense. Again, we

2023
01:05:08,419 --> 01:05:09,380
can call that function

2024
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,659
as many times as we like.

2025
01:05:10,659 --> 01:05:15,099
I could say add 123.

2026
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,119
I don't know why I

2027
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,339
didn't just copy
and base that.

2028
01:05:18,339 --> 01:05:20,580
This should give me
four alert boxes,

2029
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:28,339
all saying 1512345.

2030
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,159
Let's have quite
a few of these.

2031
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:34,279
We've got quite a few

2032
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,800
of these function calls.

2033
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,640
We have to go
through every

2034
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,259
single function
one at a time.

2035
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:42,579
If you're a bit
like me, you might

2036
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:45,820
find alert
really annoying.

2037
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,199
If we were to test this
function 100 times,

2038
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:51,179
that's 100 times we

2039
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:52,715
need to press that button.

2040
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,889
What we can do instead is

2041
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:57,450
actually print to the
Javascript console.

2042
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,009
If you aren't
aware, we can use

2043
01:05:59,009 --> 01:06:01,330
the Javascript console
in developer tools.

2044
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,789
We use developer tools for

2045
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:06,129
our mobile optimization
in weeks four.

2046
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,110
But if you go into
your browser,

2047
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:11,090
Open Developer Tools,
right click, Inspect.

2048
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,530
Next to Elements
is console.

2049
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:15,370
This is our
Javascript console.

2050
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,729
Essentially, we
can see a bunch of

2051
01:06:16,729 --> 01:06:18,669
really interesting
Javascript stuff in this.

2052
01:06:18,669 --> 01:06:20,130
If we have an
error in our code,

2053
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,269
the error will appear
in here. Let's try.

2054
01:06:23,269 --> 01:06:27,129
If I said constant
number equals ten,

2055
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:31,215
then I try assigning
this again 15.

2056
01:06:31,215 --> 01:06:32,959
I obviously make
sure you spell

2057
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:35,099
a number correctly,
not like I have.

2058
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:37,739
This should give
me an error there

2059
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:40,280
being I can't
redeclare constant.

2060
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,939
When you do have
errors in your code,

2061
01:06:41,939 --> 01:06:43,139
the errors will appear in

2062
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:44,500
this Javascript console,

2063
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,540
which is quite
interesting.

2064
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:51,369
Now again, it
might look a bit

2065
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:53,030
different depending
on your browser,

2066
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:54,890
but it's still
the same concept.

2067
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,970
You'll have a console
tab, click on console,

2068
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,170
and that's where our java

2069
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,610
script errors will appear.

2070
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:02,030
Now instead of alert,

2071
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,969
we can use a function
called console dot log.

2072
01:07:05,969 --> 01:07:07,849
This is where we can
actually print things to

2073
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,129
the console by saying

2074
01:07:10,129 --> 01:07:11,950
console dot log
and then a value.

2075
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:12,889
In our case, we're going

2076
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:13,989
from numbers one to ten,

2077
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:14,950
we're actually printing

2078
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,570
these into our console,

2079
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,929
which is quite
cool, saying

2080
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:20,850
alert all those times.

2081
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:24,989
What if we change alert
to console dot log

2082
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,670
instead of having to
click through 15 alerts?

2083
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:34,130
We now get 15 printed
into the console.

2084
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,709
It's a nicer
and it's a lot

2085
01:07:35,709 --> 01:07:37,950
easier to deal with
at this stage.

2086
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:40,289
Typically, we use
console dot log

2087
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,790
to check things are
running properly.

2088
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,449
If you want to make
sure that a function or

2089
01:07:43,449 --> 01:07:45,409
a variable value is
what you think it is,

2090
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:48,009
we can use console dot
log just to check.

2091
01:07:48,009 --> 01:07:50,549
For instance, if I want to

2092
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:51,509
see what happens if I

2093
01:07:51,509 --> 01:07:52,829
put a percentage on this,

2094
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:54,049
I could use console dot

2095
01:07:54,049 --> 01:07:55,209
log and that would get

2096
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:58,089
printed into my
console, which is fun.

2097
01:07:58,089 --> 01:07:59,450
I keep saying percentage,

2098
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,829
it's not percentage.

2099
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:02,730
It's a really
annoying operator

2100
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:03,589
that I don't like using,

2101
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:05,849
but hopefully you'll
get some use out of it

2102
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:10,070
then. That is console
dot log elements.

2103
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:11,669
Now, how can we
actually use

2104
01:08:11,669 --> 01:08:13,649
Javascript with our HTML?

2105
01:08:13,649 --> 01:08:16,090
Well, first things first,

2106
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,929
it's a bit like CSS.

2107
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:19,289
We need to figure
out what we're

2108
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:20,949
actually going
to be selecting.

2109
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:21,929
We're going to do

2110
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:24,149
all this fantastic
Javascript stuff,

2111
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:26,109
but what are we
doing it too?

2112
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:28,109
We need to select
the elements

2113
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,789
from our HTML, okay?

2114
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:33,009
Just like CSS, we need
a way of selecting

2115
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,569
those elements
so that we can

2116
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,319
then do something
to those elements.

2117
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:40,709
The easiest way to
select an element in

2118
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:42,049
Java script is by putting

2119
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:44,329
an ID on some elements.

2120
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:45,889
In our case,
we've got a H,

2121
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:47,249
one tag and a tag.

2122
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:48,929
The ID in this is
called heading

2123
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:51,069
and the ID in this
is called content.

2124
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:53,649
If I add this to my
code very quickly,

2125
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:55,169
so we'll just get
rid of all of

2126
01:08:55,169 --> 01:08:57,889
this in san of
index the HTML.

2127
01:08:57,889 --> 01:08:59,269
If I go with my heading

2128
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:01,569
and my paragraph
very quickly,

2129
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:05,009
I'll say ID equals

2130
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:07,889
H one tag because I'm
a bit lazy like that.

2131
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:10,849
And we'll say ID
equals p tag,

2132
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:13,209
but easier to remember.

2133
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,029
The easiest way
to do this is by

2134
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:18,109
putting an ID on
those elements.

2135
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:20,209
Once we have an ID
on those elements,

2136
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:21,610
we can then use
the Javascript

2137
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,929
function query selector to

2138
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,169
select it and store

2139
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:28,289
that element inside
of a variable.

2140
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,869
In our case,
we're creating

2141
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:32,009
a brand new variable
called heading.

2142
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:33,929
We're then saying equals

2143
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:36,889
document query selector,
hashtag heading.

2144
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:38,449
Actually breaking
this down a bit.

2145
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:40,029
Document in this
case is referring

2146
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:42,589
to our whole
HTML document.

2147
01:09:42,589 --> 01:09:45,129
Document is looking
for this heading

2148
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:47,589
in the entire HTML page.

2149
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,549
That's going to be

2150
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:50,029
important in next
week's lecture,

2151
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:51,849
when we specifically state

2152
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:54,209
where we want to find
certain elements.

2153
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,769
We then using the
function query selector,

2154
01:09:56,769 --> 01:09:59,769
which basically means
find this element.

2155
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,689
Then inside of
these brackets,

2156
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:04,849
we're then putting a way

2157
01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:06,089
for us to find
that element.

2158
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:07,769
In our case, we're
using an ID,

2159
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:09,209
just like in CSS.

2160
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:10,429
When we use ID's,

2161
01:10:10,429 --> 01:10:11,970
we start with a hashtag.

2162
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,549
If we're going
to use classes,

2163
01:10:13,549 --> 01:10:16,249
we'd start with a dot,
if that makes sense.

2164
01:10:16,249 --> 01:10:18,249
When we say dot
query selector,

2165
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:20,049
hashtag heading, it will

2166
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,549
look for where the
ID equals heading.

2167
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:24,109
The cool thing is,
at this stage,

2168
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:25,649
we could have just put
the tag name as well.

2169
01:10:25,649 --> 01:10:27,889
We only have one H one
tag on the screen.

2170
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:30,249
We could have said
query selector H one,

2171
01:10:30,249 --> 01:10:32,189
and that would have
given us that H one tag.

2172
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:34,610
But using ID, we can
just be absolutely

2173
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,589
certain that is the ID

2174
01:10:36,589 --> 01:10:38,679
that we would
like to select.

2175
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:41,149
Okay, so we're
going to say

2176
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,529
let heading
equals documents,

2177
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:45,970
do query selector,
normal brackets,

2178
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,669
quotation mark, then the

2179
01:10:47,669 --> 01:10:50,369
ID hash tag, the ID name.

2180
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:52,189
Doing this in our
example, I'm going to

2181
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:56,189
say let h one tag
because again,

2182
01:10:56,189 --> 01:10:57,349
I'm being a bit
lazy on this.

2183
01:10:57,349 --> 01:11:01,214
One equals document
query selector

2184
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:05,499
hashtag on tag because

2185
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:06,779
again it's essentially

2186
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:08,099
being called what
the idea is,

2187
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:10,199
it's one tag just there.

2188
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,179
If I want to find the tag,

2189
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:15,219
it would be let
tag or paragraph.

2190
01:11:15,219 --> 01:11:16,599
Again, the variable
name is up

2191
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:19,179
to you equals documents,

2192
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:24,059
query selector
hashtag tag.

2193
01:11:24,059 --> 01:11:26,239
That would get
me both the H

2194
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,039
one tag and the tag.

2195
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:30,639
Hopefully, that
makes some sense.

2196
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,399
Go down this throat
is killing me.

2197
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,079
Now we've got
these elements,

2198
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:39,739
we can actually do

2199
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:41,939
some fun stuff
with them. Y two.

2200
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:43,019
We could change the text

2201
01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:44,619
inside of these tags.

2202
01:11:44,619 --> 01:11:48,039
Right now, our H one
tag says heading.

2203
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:49,819
What would it be
called if we changed

2204
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:51,579
this to something else?

2205
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:53,539
The way we can do this is

2206
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:55,099
by selecting
that variable.

2207
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:59,119
In our case, it's
heading first.

2208
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:00,639
Using our CSS knowledge,

2209
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:02,079
we know that first
child is typically

2210
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,819
the first element in
that element itself.

2211
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:07,919
We'll go more into
depth about why that's

2212
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:09,439
the case in
subsequent lectures,

2213
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:10,479
but we're just going
to say heading,

2214
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,719
first child node value

2215
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,259
equals and then a value.
When we type this,

2216
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:19,859
that's going to
change the content

2217
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:21,579
inside of our H one tag.

2218
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:23,979
Well, that's the
idea. Anyway, let's

2219
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:25,959
actually see what happens.

2220
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:27,539
Let's say we're just

2221
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:28,559
going to change
the H one tag.

2222
01:12:28,559 --> 01:12:29,779
So all of space here,

2223
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:32,899
I'll say one tag first

2224
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:37,199
child node value equals.

2225
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:41,379
And we'll just say
this has changed.

2226
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,259
Now let's see
if this works.

2227
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,819
It doesn't. We
actually get an error.

2228
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:51,299
The error says, cannot

2229
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:53,599
read properties of null.

2230
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:55,759
Now, that's
interesting, isn't

2231
01:12:55,759 --> 01:12:57,579
it? Why is it said that?

2232
01:12:57,579 --> 01:13:01,479
Any guesses. Again, using

2233
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:02,199
everything we've just

2234
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,280
learned about Javascript.

2235
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,479
Why is it said that?

2236
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,879
Now a big tip from me

2237
01:13:08,879 --> 01:13:10,599
is always have your
console open when you're

2238
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:12,359
doing Javascript
because even if things

2239
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:14,679
look like it's working,
it might not be.

2240
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:17,059
When you get an error,
there is something

2241
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:20,679
catastrophically wrong
with your code, it.

2242
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,019
What is the issue?
That's the question.

2243
01:13:25,019 --> 01:13:27,759
If you remember back to
our first alert box,

2244
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:29,719
our Javascript code runs

2245
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:33,079
before our HTML
exists on that page.

2246
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:35,079
That's why our code
is not working

2247
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:38,420
properly when we're
running this Javascript.

2248
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,239
These tags don't exist
yet because again,

2249
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:43,079
it's going in the
order it's created.

2250
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:44,779
It's basically
running this code

2251
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:47,139
before these elements
exist on that page.

2252
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:49,679
We're trying to find
this H one tag,

2253
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,259
but the H one tag
doesn't exist yet,

2254
01:13:52,259 --> 01:13:54,579
because again, our
Javascript is running

2255
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:59,029
before our HTML. So
how can we fix that?

2256
01:13:59,029 --> 01:14:01,579
Well, the really easy
solution is we're just

2257
01:14:01,579 --> 01:14:02,639
going to add an attribute

2258
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:03,739
into our script tag.

2259
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:07,099
We can use defer that
basically says run

2260
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:09,179
our Javascript code once

2261
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:11,699
our HTML exists
on that page,

2262
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:13,139
inside a script,
we're going to

2263
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:14,479
say script source equals

2264
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:18,419
scripts defer inside
that opening script tag.

2265
01:14:18,419 --> 01:14:21,219
Again, all it's
saying is just wait,

2266
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:23,199
don't run our
Javascript just yet.

2267
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,459
Wait for our HTML
to exist first,

2268
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:27,779
and then run our
Javascript code.

2269
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:29,399
There are other ways
of achieving this.

2270
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:31,519
We could use specific
event listeners.

2271
01:14:31,519 --> 01:14:32,939
But in my opinion, this is

2272
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:34,659
a slightly easier way
of teaching you for

2273
01:14:34,659 --> 01:14:36,459
the first time by

2274
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:39,259
just adding defer
into my script tag.

2275
01:14:39,259 --> 01:14:43,819
Like this, we
should now go from

2276
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:48,799
heading to this has
changed, right?

2277
01:14:48,799 --> 01:14:50,739
That's now actually
changing our content.

2278
01:14:50,739 --> 01:14:52,399
If I change something
key, I added

2279
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:54,999
some explanation
marks that

2280
01:14:54,999 --> 01:14:57,639
should also change here.

2281
01:14:57,639 --> 01:14:59,039
It's the exact same thing

2282
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:00,039
for this tag as well.

2283
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:08,099
If I said tag first
child value equals,

2284
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,259
this should also
change as well,

2285
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:18,199
just like pretty
cool, right?

2286
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:19,779
That's essentially
how we're

2287
01:15:19,779 --> 01:15:21,159
going to fix that error.

2288
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:23,579
Again, don't panic
if you see an error,

2289
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:25,519
just see what
the error says

2290
01:15:25,519 --> 01:15:27,439
and try your
best to fix it.

2291
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:28,999
In our case, when
the error is said,

2292
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:30,599
cannot read
properties of null.

2293
01:15:30,599 --> 01:15:31,939
Null is referring to

2294
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:34,019
the element doesn't
currently exist.

2295
01:15:34,019 --> 01:15:36,319
There's no value
on that element,

2296
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,579
there's just
nothing there.

2297
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:38,979
We can't do
anything with it.

2298
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:40,739
We're trying to select

2299
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:42,459
the first child and change

2300
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:44,379
the value of
that first child

2301
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:47,019
if that element doesn't
have anything to it.

2302
01:15:47,019 --> 01:15:49,599
Of course it's going
to error again.

2303
01:15:49,599 --> 01:15:50,319
Just try and read it.

2304
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:51,339
But the real useful part

2305
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:52,279
on this is it actually

2306
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:53,779
tells you the exact line

2307
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:54,879
that the issue is on.

2308
01:15:54,879 --> 01:15:56,879
In our case, it was
line number three.

2309
01:15:56,879 --> 01:15:59,079
Looking at line three,

2310
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:01,979
it was this pictures here.

2311
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:04,279
Basically, it's kind of

2312
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:05,359
the start of
the end point,

2313
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:06,739
but it roughly
tells you kind of

2314
01:16:06,739 --> 01:16:08,279
where that error is.

2315
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:09,619
So if your file
is quite big,

2316
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:10,879
it's quite useful
to narrow down

2317
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,979
where that mistake lies

2318
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,319
moving forward,
then this is

2319
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:19,679
what we're going
to end on today.

2320
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,619
Very nearly there,
don't worry.

2321
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,659
This is event listeners
and this is what

2322
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:25,459
you're going to use
for the assignment.

2323
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:26,579
Believe it or not,
this is where

2324
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:28,399
we're connecting
everything together.

2325
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:30,319
We can use event
listeners to run

2326
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,919
a function when something
specific happens,

2327
01:16:32,919 --> 01:16:34,639
when a specific
event occurs.

2328
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:36,999
We can do something.
This could

2329
01:16:36,999 --> 01:16:38,839
be when an element
has been clicked on,

2330
01:16:38,839 --> 01:16:40,099
when the page loads, when

2331
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:41,359
we press a specific key,

2332
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:42,679
when we even do our mouse

2333
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:44,079
over a certain element.

2334
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:45,499
But the rough syntax,

2335
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:48,019
the structure for
this is the element.

2336
01:16:48,019 --> 01:16:50,099
So what are we
adding this to?

2337
01:16:50,099 --> 01:16:52,739
The function
event listener.

2338
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:54,679
The event in question,

2339
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:56,799
Are we clicking? Are
we pressing a key?

2340
01:16:56,799 --> 01:16:59,559
What's triggering
this? Then the code,

2341
01:16:59,559 --> 01:17:02,199
the function that will
run on this event.

2342
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:04,659
Putting this into
an actual example.

2343
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:08,179
One event type is called
dom content loaded.

2344
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:10,439
We use do content
loaded in

2345
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:12,319
a very similar way to
how defer was used.

2346
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,019
Do content loaded
basically means

2347
01:17:15,019 --> 01:17:18,559
do this once our HTML
exists on that page.

2348
01:17:18,559 --> 01:17:20,679
Document in this
case is referring

2349
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:21,999
to the entire web page.

2350
01:17:21,999 --> 01:17:23,279
We're saying when the

2351
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:25,764
entire web page is
finished loading

2352
01:17:25,764 --> 01:17:28,669
the code in our change
heading function.

2353
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:30,869
But again, we're
doing this exactly

2354
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:32,589
like we've done it with
the Defer attributes.

2355
01:17:32,589 --> 01:17:33,969
We don't quite
need to do this.

2356
01:17:33,969 --> 01:17:36,829
A slightly more fun
one is called click.

2357
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:38,769
The click event triggers

2358
01:17:38,769 --> 01:17:40,349
when an element is
being clicked on.

2359
01:17:40,349 --> 01:17:41,889
In our case,
when we say do

2360
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:44,649
add listener, click
change Heading.

2361
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:46,809
When we click anywhere
on our document,

2362
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:47,849
it will run the code in

2363
01:17:47,849 --> 01:17:49,629
our change
heading function.

2364
01:17:49,629 --> 01:17:51,409
Let's try it.

2365
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:54,169
If I put this into a
function really quickly,

2366
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:59,629
we'll say function
change one tag.

2367
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:00,509
Again,

2368
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,749
I like doing slightly
different examples.

2369
01:18:02,749 --> 01:18:04,709
The cool thing
is we can format

2370
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:06,694
this to look a bit
nicer as well.

2371
01:18:06,694 --> 01:18:08,499
We can then say document,

2372
01:18:08,499 --> 01:18:10,479
do, add event listener,

2373
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:16,059
click, change one tag.

2374
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:19,479
Now we have the heading,

2375
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:21,879
but when I click
somewhere on this page,

2376
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:27,479
that now changes.
Pretty cool, right?

2377
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,239
To be hiding that
behind the click,

2378
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,159
The cool thing is I
can click anywhere on

2379
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,759
this document and it
will change like so.

2380
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,679
Now, while that's
pretty cool,

2381
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,779
wouldn't it be cool if we

2382
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:45,099
could specifically
target the heading tag?

2383
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:47,174
If we just clicked
on the heading

2384
01:18:47,174 --> 01:18:49,729
only then would the
heading change.

2385
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:51,929
It could be
interesting, right?

2386
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:54,229
When we use document
dot event listener.

2387
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,149
We're saying when
the entire page

2388
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:57,929
has been clicked
anywhere on this page.

2389
01:18:57,929 --> 01:18:59,109
If that's been clicked,

2390
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,689
run that piece of code.

2391
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:02,289
But we can call

2392
01:19:02,289 --> 01:19:04,769
an event listener onto
a specific element.

2393
01:19:04,769 --> 01:19:06,569
This works exactly
the same way

2394
01:19:06,569 --> 01:19:08,509
as document dot
event listener.

2395
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:10,309
But instead of
document, we're going

2396
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:12,289
to use the event
variable instead.

2397
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,709
In our case, we're still
finding the heading,

2398
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,169
We've still got
our function,

2399
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,389
but we're setting
heading, event listener.

2400
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:20,149
Click change heading.

2401
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:21,909
Adding this to our code,

2402
01:19:21,909 --> 01:19:23,650
We'll just move
this outside.

2403
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,229
So we'll put this up here

2404
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:28,354
and we'll change
this to H, one tag.

2405
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:33,999
So now I click anywhere,
nothing happens.

2406
01:19:33,999 --> 01:19:35,459
If I just click on my

2407
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:37,579
heading, then it changes.

2408
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:39,339
And that is how

2409
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:40,839
you're going to do
the Start button.

2410
01:19:40,839 --> 01:19:42,539
So you're going to
find the Start button.

2411
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:44,019
When you click on
the Start button,

2412
01:19:44,019 --> 01:19:46,079
you're then going
to run some code.

2413
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:47,699
That's as far as I go on

2414
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,999
that point, but if
you think about it,

2415
01:19:49,999 --> 01:19:51,619
you need to start
the game when that

2416
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:54,839
start button has
been pressed, Okay.

2417
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,879
Forms. Now, back
in week four,

2418
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:03,679
we used forms to do
our contact page,

2419
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,159
but we couldn't
really do anything in

2420
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:07,299
them using Java Script.

2421
01:20:07,299 --> 01:20:08,759
We can, we can actually

2422
01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:09,919
read the value of some of

2423
01:20:09,919 --> 01:20:13,419
our inputs by using the
dot value property.

2424
01:20:13,419 --> 01:20:14,859
In our case,
we've got a very

2425
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:16,179
basic HTML form here.

2426
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:18,479
We've got a text box
and a Submit button.

2427
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:20,680
If we find that textbox,

2428
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,199
we can then say
textbovalue

2429
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,879
to give us the exact
value of that form.

2430
01:20:25,879 --> 01:20:28,039
In this case, I'm
saying hello World.

2431
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:29,879
The second I
click on Submit,

2432
01:20:29,879 --> 01:20:31,699
it will then say
Hello World.

2433
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:33,879
Pretty cool, right?

2434
01:20:33,879 --> 01:20:36,019
That's all being
built around

2435
01:20:36,019 --> 01:20:37,239
exactly the same principle

2436
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:38,919
we, I've just taught you.

2437
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:40,379
We find that text box,

2438
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:41,880
we had an alert
saying textbox

2439
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,959
p value and we're only

2440
01:20:42,959 --> 01:20:44,199
going to read
that content.

2441
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:46,739
Find that function read,
use that function,

2442
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:47,719
read content, and we

2443
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:49,539
click on that
Submit button.

2444
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:52,339
Pretty fun because I've

2445
01:20:52,339 --> 01:20:53,799
been talking for what
feels like ours.

2446
01:20:53,799 --> 01:20:55,139
Now let's set you

2447
01:20:55,139 --> 01:20:56,980
onto your last
batch of exercises.

2448
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,659
I want you to
create a function

2449
01:20:58,659 --> 01:21:01,339
called print five that
has five alerts in it.

2450
01:21:01,339 --> 01:21:03,939
Numbers one to five in
their own alert box.

2451
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:07,019
Call that function twice
when the page loads.

2452
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:10,174
You should have ten
alert pop ups in total.

2453
01:21:10,174 --> 01:21:12,869
Try replacing alert
with console dot log

2454
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,469
so it's a little
less annoying.

2455
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,089
Make sure you can see

2456
01:21:16,089 --> 01:21:18,969
those numbers being
printed to your console.

2457
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:21,709
I then want you
to add your

2458
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,289
H one element to
your page and give

2459
01:21:23,289 --> 01:21:25,049
the H one element an ID

2460
01:21:25,049 --> 01:21:26,689
using an event listener.

2461
01:21:26,689 --> 01:21:29,309
Update the content of
that H one element

2462
01:21:29,309 --> 01:21:31,009
so that when
the page loads

2463
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:33,369
the content of that
H one changes,

2464
01:21:33,369 --> 01:21:36,449
add another element
like a tag,

2465
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:37,849
and update the
contents the

2466
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:39,469
same way you did
to the H one.

2467
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:41,189
You should only
need one function

2468
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:43,889
and one event
listener. For this,

2469
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,439
try using a click
event instead.

2470
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:48,819
When you refresh the page,

2471
01:21:48,819 --> 01:21:50,359
the H one and P tags

2472
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:52,579
should start with
their default values.

2473
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,059
When you then
click on the page,

2474
01:21:54,059 --> 01:21:54,879
they should then be

2475
01:21:54,879 --> 01:21:57,499
updated to extend
this further.

2476
01:21:57,499 --> 01:21:58,279
Make it so that when you

2477
01:21:58,279 --> 01:21:59,479
click on the H one tag,

2478
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:01,659
on the H one tag
changes When you

2479
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:04,359
click on the tag on
the tag changes.

2480
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:05,539
In this case, you'll need

2481
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:07,039
two different
event listeners

2482
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:08,319
with two different
functions.

2483
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:11,639
One for the H one
tag, one for the tag.

2484
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:13,679
Lastly, I want
you to create

2485
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,099
a very basic H twML form.

2486
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:15,819
Feel free to use

2487
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:17,419
your assignment
form if you like.

2488
01:22:17,419 --> 01:22:19,039
I want you to
make it so that

2489
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:20,339
when you click
on a button,

2490
01:22:20,339 --> 01:22:21,579
you display the value of

2491
01:22:21,579 --> 01:22:23,379
the text box in an alert.

2492
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:25,519
Then try adding a
div to the page.

2493
01:22:25,519 --> 01:22:27,899
And then when you click
on the button again,

2494
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:30,579
try changing
the divs value

2495
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:33,419
to that value in the form.

2496
01:22:33,419 --> 01:22:36,279
Pretty fun. Once
you've done all this,

2497
01:22:36,279 --> 01:22:38,279
you should have a
fairly good grasp

2498
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:40,214
of the basics
of Java script

2499
01:22:40,214 --> 01:22:41,929
If you are
struggling a bit,

2500
01:22:41,929 --> 01:22:42,809
which I think some of

2501
01:22:42,809 --> 01:22:44,449
you might at this stage,

2502
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:46,869
Javascript is
significantly harder

2503
01:22:46,869 --> 01:22:48,089
than HTM on CSS.

2504
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:49,729
Here are some very
useful links.

2505
01:22:49,729 --> 01:22:50,969
There's quite a
few, but we have

2506
01:22:50,969 --> 01:22:52,389
covered quite a lot today.

2507
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:53,949
There's this
very nice first

2508
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:56,689
steps documentation
you can look at.

2509
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:58,249
There's query
selector, there's

2510
01:22:58,249 --> 01:23:00,269
specific areas
on script tags,

2511
01:23:00,269 --> 01:23:02,409
there's alerts, there's
console dot log,

2512
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:04,689
different functions,
variables, events.

2513
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:06,109
And there's a
really nice linked

2514
01:23:06,109 --> 01:23:07,210
in learning Javascript,

2515
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,549
of course, that
I'd recommend.

2516
01:23:08,549 --> 01:23:10,409
Again, if you are
struggling a bit today,

2517
01:23:10,409 --> 01:23:12,009
might be worth
going over a few of

2518
01:23:12,009 --> 01:23:14,715
these very useful bits
of documentation.

2519
01:23:14,715 --> 01:23:16,419
But yeah, that concludes

2520
01:23:16,419 --> 01:23:18,299
our first
Javascript lecture.

2521
01:23:18,299 --> 01:23:19,719
Please do attend next week

2522
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:20,679
because we are
going to go over

2523
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:21,999
some really crucial
information to

2524
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:24,399
the assignment
after next week.

2525
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:25,099
I think you then have

2526
01:23:25,099 --> 01:23:26,239
two weeks off for Easter.

2527
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,199
We'll double check that
with the calendar,

2528
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:30,199
but I think we've got
two Javascript lectures

2529
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:31,519
and then two weeks off,

2530
01:23:31,519 --> 01:23:33,059
which should
be quite nice.

2531
01:23:33,059 --> 01:23:34,419
Just remember
your grades will

2532
01:23:34,419 --> 01:23:36,439
be released in
four weeks time.

2533
01:23:36,439 --> 01:23:38,319
I would probably
start working on

2534
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:40,159
the Javascript assignment
as soon as you can.

2535
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,899
From today, you can

2536
01:23:41,899 --> 01:23:43,479
try getting that
Start button.

2537
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:44,999
Maybe try
starting the game

2538
01:23:44,999 --> 01:23:46,599
when the Start button
has been pressed.

2539
01:23:46,599 --> 01:23:48,099
Next week I'll
teach you how to

2540
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:50,640
add CSS to Javascript,

2541
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,999
or you can try learning
that yourself.

2542
01:23:52,999 --> 01:23:53,759
Why not?

2543
01:23:53,759 --> 01:23:56,399
But yeah, best of
luck to everyone.

2544
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:58,599
I think it's going
to be a good year.

2545
01:23:58,599 --> 01:23:59,939
Okay. It's already been

2546
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:01,639
a good year, but you
know what I mean?

2547
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:02,679
But come along to

2548
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:03,999
the Friday sport
session if you

2549
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:06,259
want to see how these
exercises are finished.

2550
01:24:06,259 --> 01:24:08,279
Okay. All completed.

2551
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:10,279
You are particularly
struggling though.

2552
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,919
I do recommend using
some of these links,

2553
01:24:11,919 --> 01:24:13,880
They are very
useful resources.

2554
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,479
Yeah, I will see
everyone next week.

2555
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:17,579
Hopefully I have
a good one.
