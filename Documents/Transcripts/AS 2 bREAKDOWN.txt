1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Right. Welcome back
to week eight.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,040
Officially,

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,640
the first assignment
has now been handed in,

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,960
so the majority
of you have

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,560
now submitted
successfully.

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,080
Hopefully, you
should be getting

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,259
your grades back
within four weeks.

8
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,159
Again, our post
announcement and

9
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,440
all the grade grades

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,639
and feedback have
been released.

11
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,239
But generally,
it looks like

12
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,860
performance has been
really good so far.

13
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,060
So hopefully, we can carry

14
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,100
that through to the
second assignment.

15
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,719
For whatever
reason you haven't

16
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,220
submitted at this stage,

17
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,779
you can submit up to
seven days later,

18
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,479
seven days past
the deadline,

19
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:32,639
but that would
be capped to a D

20
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,519
minus anything
later than that.

21
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,219
And unfortunately,

22
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,499
that doesn't count
as a submission,

23
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,185
which would be a G grade.

24
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:39,390
Again, if you haven't

25
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,650
submitted at this stage,

26
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,349
get it in as urgently as

27
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,250
possible because that
would still count,

28
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,449
it would just
be capped to a

29
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:47,990
minus at this late stage.

30
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,049
It's probably a
bit too late to

31
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
apply for mitigating
circumstances,

32
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,130
but you can still
possibly try,

33
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,889
sometimes are a bit
lenient on that.

34
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,909
But again, technically

35
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:57,550
the deadline is
now fully passed.

36
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,970
Do you remember
that's only 25%

37
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,390
of the assessment though.

38
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,189
What we're focusing
on now from

39
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,750
weeks eight to 14 is

40
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,509
the 75% the big

41
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,724
chunk key part of
the assessment.

42
00:01:08,724 --> 00:01:10,239
Just before we go into

43
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,200
the electric
content today,

44
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,359
we're just going
to briefly look

45
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,439
back through the
second assignment.

46
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,699
Just Webern is completely

47
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,980
aware of what they're
working towards,

48
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,279
but officially this
assignment was

49
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:17,899
released when

50
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,619
the first assignment
was released.

51
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,459
This was almost just
over two months ago now.

52
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,820
Which was fun.

53
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,180
Yeah, let's crack
into it then.

54
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,199
Your second assignment
is due in on

55
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:32,205
the 19th of the
fifth 2024.

56
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:33,750
Quite a ways away yet,

57
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,550
so don't worry about it.

58
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,150
Plus, we've got two
weeks off for Easter,

59
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,549
which should
give you ample

60
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,690
opportunity to
have a go at this.

61
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,170
Essentially, you've
got January,

62
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,329
every March, April, May.

63
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,930
It's 19 May,

64
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,730
202-41-1509 This
assignment is

65
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,990
structured a
bit differently

66
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,750
to the one you've
just done.

67
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,549
Essentially,

68
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,715
this is really going
to be focusing on

69
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,400
programming, the
programming side to

70
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,699
web development
with HTML and CSS.

71
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,599
We focused on the
look of these pages,

72
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,140
making them as
optimized and

73
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,240
as fantastic as they
possibly can be,

74
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,960
where we can add
different bits

75
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,999
of content here or there.

76
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,960
With this assignment,
we're primarily

77
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,939
focused on the actual
coding part to it.

78
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,479
Creating variables,

79
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,139
if statements, four loops.

80
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,059
Not only that, but

81
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,699
doing it in an
efficient way.

82
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,359
You could do 1,000

83
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,260
lines to make something
quite simple,

84
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,519
but you could also
achieve the same

85
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,320
result in just
three lines.

86
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,039
That's where a lot of
these marks are from.

87
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,079
Breaking up a little bit.

88
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,800
Assessment two
is essentially

89
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,020
going to assess
your ability to

90
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,519
do HTML, CSS,
and Javascript.

91
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,039
The bulk of this
assignment is going

92
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,540
to be performed
in Javascript.

93
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,799
Let's go zoom in just in

94
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,959
case people are
struggling to see.

95
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,079
Now again, the big
difference with

96
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,139
this assignment
is I actually

97
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,439
give you some
code for this.

98
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,700
The idea is you're
going to build

99
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,779
off the code
that I've given

100
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:53,099
you in Nile bit.

101
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,320
Have a teaser of
what's coming up.

102
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,140
Don't worry.

103
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,199
Let's go to go in to

104
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,340
a student preview
very quickly.

105
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,449
If you go to
assessments and

106
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,289
submissions in AS two,

107
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,929
these are
currently the only

108
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,010
assessment items
I've released.

109
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,069
Eventually, we will have

110
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,049
the submission
points in there.

111
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:10,729
I'll probably also

112
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:11,949
create a video
demonstration

113
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:13,649
walking you through the
submission process.

114
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:14,490
It's a little bit

115
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,069
different to the
first assignment.

116
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,689
The first assignment
we used to get

117
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,469
Hub and get this one.

118
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,229
It's not the way

119
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:21,250
you're actually
going to submit

120
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,510
this is just getting
all your code,

121
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,710
putting it into
a zip file,

122
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,955
and then submitting
that zip file.

123
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,759
I'd recommend you download

124
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,859
the AS two zip file

125
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,039
because this is
essentially what you're

126
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,819
going to be building
the assignment from.

127
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,819
When you open up the
AS two zip file,

128
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,500
you get greeted to
something like realized,

129
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,659
that's the
grade, apologies

130
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,459
you get greeted to this.

131
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,900
It's a very basic template

132
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,659
for a game, completely
original game.

133
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,980
I haven't stolen
it from anywhere.

134
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,319
Obviously, it's my own

135
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,360
individual property
patent pending.

136
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,944
But this is
called Snack Man,

137
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,790
essentially. It's a very
simple Pac Man game.

138
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,829
I've given you the
basic gooey for this.

139
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,130
So you've got the
maze, you've got

140
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,390
the characters, you've
got the leaderboard,

141
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,549
you've got these
button prompts,

142
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,229
which my camera is
annoyingly hiding where.

143
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:09,530
You've got the
button prompts here,

144
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,769
you've got this nice
score, and you've

145
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,549
got these levels
up in the corner.

146
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,129
I put these in for you.

147
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,710
Essentially, your
assignment is

148
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,750
to build the functionality
for this game.

149
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,290
Now the game of the
game is to move

150
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,689
the player
around the maze,

151
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,729
collecting the points.

152
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,329
Once they've collected
all the points,

153
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,204
that game should
come to an end.

154
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:27,720
The player
shouldn't be able

155
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,859
to go through the
walls of the maze,

156
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:29,920
and when they
encounter one of

157
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,780
the enemy characters,

158
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,240
the game should also end.

159
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,939
Again, putting
out perspective.

160
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,700
You shouldn't be able

161
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,599
to go through these walls,

162
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,219
you need to be able to
collect these points.

163
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:38,320
And if I encounter one of

164
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,199
these green circles,
the game should end.

165
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,960
So that's like
the end state.

166
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,859
We have a score

167
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,179
counter up here
that should also

168
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,020
reflect the number of

169
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,519
points you collect
in the maze.

170
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,499
Now, I've not
been too cruel,

171
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:49,920
I have given you a bit

172
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,400
of functionality for this.

173
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,979
The functionality I've
given you is moving

174
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,439
the character around the
maze with the rakes.

175
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,539
We can move the character,

176
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,295
but that's
really about it.

177
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,830
Everything else
you're going

178
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,910
to have to do yourselves.

179
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,750
So you've got to create
some collision so

180
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,610
the character can't just

181
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,690
walk through these walls.

182
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,290
You're going to need

183
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,130
that same collision to

184
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,089
work for these points as

185
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,750
well and also
the collision

186
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,129
to work on the
enemy characters.

187
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,209
The idea is my encounter

188
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,370
one of these
enemy characters.

189
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,130
It's game over,
essentially

190
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,609
nice and simple, openly.

191
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,050
Essentially, you're
going to make

192
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,779
this game fully
functional.

193
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,050
Getting into

194
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,769
the specific requirements
for the brief.

195
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,150
Then they're
separated into

196
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,529
the grade boundaries.

197
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,889
Right here, we've
got everything

198
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,489
you need for a bare pass,

199
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:32,669
a D minus to a D plus.

200
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,850
Okay? We also then
have a good pass,

201
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,509
a very good pass, and
an excellent pass,

202
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,970
and it goes on like that.

203
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,250
But we'll just
focus on the

204
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,290
passing criteria
to begin with.

205
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,810
The first requirement is

206
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,049
when the start
button is pressed,

207
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,710
the game should begin, and

208
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,990
the start button should
no longer be visible.

209
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,770
That essentially
means when I click on

210
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,229
this start button,
it should disappear.

211
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,609
Hopefully,
everyone should be

212
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:54,949
able to achieve
that after today,

213
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,595
though, it's one of the
easier requirements.

214
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:00,100
The next one is the
player should not be able

215
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,759
to move until

216
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,179
the start button
has been pressed.

217
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,819
Right now, I can move
around the screen

218
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:05,199
without pressing
the Start button.

219
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,320
That movement needs to be

220
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,779
locked behind the
Start button.

221
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,440
So the idea is I click
the Start button,

222
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
I can then move the
character effectively.

223
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,620
When you press Start,
it starts the game.

224
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,300
You need to stop
the player from

225
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,899
walking through
the mazes walls.

226
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,459
The walls of the maze
are these blue squares.

227
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,060
They're also dotted around

228
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,260
the center of the
maze as well.

229
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,719
You basically just need
to add that collision

230
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,780
in because like
I said right now

231
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,720
we can walk through
them and it's not very

232
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,700
good when

233
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,319
the player touches
one of the points.

234
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,060
The points are

235
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,679
the small white
circles in the maze.

236
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,900
You need to remove
the point from

237
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,400
the maze and get

238
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,160
this score counter
to go up by one.

239
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,739
Essentially,

240
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,199
the player is
collecting these points

241
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,339
and this point counter

242
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,539
reflects the
number of points

243
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,939
the players basically.

244
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,280
Obviously, right
now we're on zero

245
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,300
because we haven't
collected any.

246
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,399
Oh,

247
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,509
once all the points

248
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,869
have been collected
by the player,

249
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,870
you need to display
a game over message,

250
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,649
just signifying that
the game has ended.

251
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,570
And again, this is
quite easy to do.

252
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,890
You can either use
the Start button

253
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,249
or you could do what's
called an alert,

254
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:08,890
which we'll get
into later today.

255
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,449
But effectively, once
you've collected

256
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,029
all the points,
it's game over.

257
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,790
Then the last one is if

258
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,249
the player touches
the enemy,

259
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:17,950
you need to have

260
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,049
the same game over
message appear.

261
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,389
And the player will also

262
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,769
display the
dead animation.

263
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:24,990
That's just using
the CSS class dead.

264
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,630
So you're just going
to put this class on

265
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,270
the player and that
should make them die.

266
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,070
Let's see this in action.

267
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,629
The benefits of
having branches.

268
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,530
I can't move
the character.

269
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,690
The second I click Start,

270
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,050
the start button
disappears

271
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,790
and I can then move
the character.

272
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,510
I can then collect
these points.

273
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,890
And you can see the
point counts wrap in

274
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,830
the corner going
up by one.

275
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,250
I can't go through the
walls of the maze.

276
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,365
There is collision there,

277
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,479
and if I collect
all the points,

278
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,420
it's the game over.

279
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,040
But if I also encounter
this enemy character,

280
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,080
it's game over as well.

281
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,659
Now I've used
the Start button

282
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,000
to signify it's game over.

283
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
But if you had
another method of

284
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,660
showing its game over,

285
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,819
that would also be fine.

286
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,280
Like I said from
today, we are going to

287
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,440
look at alerts again.

288
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,240
Maybe use alerts, why not?

289
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,740
That's everything you need

290
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,634
for a bar pass, though.

291
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,649
Essentially start button

292
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,990
pressed, it disappears.

293
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,290
The player shouldn't
be able to

294
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,149
move until the start
button has been pressed.

295
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,969
When the player
touches the points

296
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:30,229
that collects the points,

297
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,070
you need the wall
collision in there,

298
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,370
and then you need to
signify it's game over.

299
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,110
When the two game

300
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,249
over states have
been reached,

301
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,989
that's when all the
points are collected or

302
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:38,849
when the player

303
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,550
encounters the
enemy character.

304
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,549
Everyone at a minimum
needs to achieve this.

305
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,149
Without this, you're not

306
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,550
going to pass the assignm.

307
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,449
The nice thing is,
every single lecture

308
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,129
from this moment on is

309
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,289
built around each of
these requirements.

310
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:54,769
Today we're focused on

311
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,930
adding event listeners,

312
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,990
which is going
to be absolutely

313
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,424
crucial to these
first two steps.

314
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:00,819
The week after that,

315
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:01,720
we're going to be focusing

316
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,760
more on specifically
targeting elements,

317
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,579
which will be useful for

318
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,360
pretty much all
this criteria.

319
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,079
When we come back
after Easter,

320
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,499
we're focused on
collision detection,

321
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,099
which is huge
when it comes to

322
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,620
the collision
for the walls

323
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,300
and the collision
for the points.

324
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,739
Again, each lecture is

325
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,399
designed to
build upon this.

326
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,239
Don't panic if you
don't know it.

327
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,300
We're only on lecture one

328
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,334
Pa Java script. Okay,

329
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:26,189
for a good pass, it

330
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,710
does get
progressively harder.

331
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,930
You need to randomize

332
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,470
the position of the
enemies at the start.

333
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,990
With the bar
pass criteria,

334
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,190
that enemy is
always going to be

335
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,650
in exactly the same place.

336
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,409
Okay? Nothing's
changing with

337
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:41,229
that enemy when we
get into a good pass.

338
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:43,590
That's the grade criteria.

339
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,889
We're randomizing
these positions.

340
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,809
Each time I
click, refresh,

341
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:50,410
every time I refresh
the browser,

342
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,370
these positions
get randomized.

343
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,610
In theory, the game

344
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,550
is never going
to be the same

345
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,219
now because we're

346
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,439
randomizing
these positions,

347
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,559
another requirement is
just making sure that

348
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,980
where these enemies spawn

349
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,160
in, it's appropriate.

350
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,340
For example, the
enemies aren't

351
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,740
going to be spawning
outside the maze.

352
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,919
They won't be
spawning where

353
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,060
the walls of the maze are.

354
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,080
They're only going to
be spawning inside

355
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,280
the maze where
there's a free space,

356
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,059
that's where we're going

357
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,640
to put those enemies.

358
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,780
By enemies, I mean
the green circle.

359
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,699
So everyone's okay
with that terminology,

360
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,780
this is quite tricky.

361
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,260
You also need
to add random

362
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,200
movement to these enemies.

363
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,860
The idea is
they're not just

364
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,080
static, they're not
just staying there.

365
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,939
They're actually
going to be

366
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,060
moving throughout
the maze.

367
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,660
There are bonus
points available

368
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,260
if they don't get stuck.

369
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,080
If they come into
contact with a wall,

370
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,979
they shouldn't just
stay on that wall.

371
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,599
They should hit the
wall and go into

372
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,519
the opposite direction or

373
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,040
go into a new direction.

374
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,240
If they get stuck,

375
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,919
you'll lose a few
marks here or there.

376
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,960
But the point I want

377
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,840
to make with
this is you're

378
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,920
also having the
wall collision

379
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,820
on the enemies itself.

380
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,200
Now if you've done
this properly,

381
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,120
so if you've done this
with the past criteria

382
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,159
in a good way, you
should be able to re,

383
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,860
use that method,
that way of doing

384
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,980
it in this if
that makes sense.

385
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,219
Trying to be quite
vague on that.

386
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,020
The enemies also
need to stop

387
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,520
moving when

388
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,434
the game overstate
has been reached.

389
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:12,770
So once the player has

390
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,889
collected all
the points or

391
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,110
obviously there's
been a collision

392
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,309
between the enemy
and the player,

393
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,449
that's also game over.

394
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,870
The next one is,
instead of saying

395
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,869
game over, try
displaying restart.

396
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,050
This will allow the player

397
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,210
to restart the game

398
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,829
instead of having to just

399
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,170
be over and
clicking refresh.

400
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,869
Essentially, when
you click restart,

401
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,670
the game resets back
to its original state.

402
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,089
That would be
all the points

403
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:36,929
being back in the maze,

404
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,929
the players position
being back where it was,

405
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,009
and the enemies being in

406
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,810
a new randomized location.

407
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,170
It's effectively the same

408
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,350
as refreshing the browser.

409
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,029
Essentially, instead
of game over,

410
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,890
it's going to say restart

411
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,280
or play again.
For instance,

412
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,390
the last one, which
is a bit easier,

413
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,390
I think I always
like to throwing

414
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,609
one of the easy
ones in this one,

415
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:55,469
because I think a lot of

416
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:56,990
this criteria is
quite challenging.

417
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,790
Is I want you to

418
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,130
implement those
arrow buttons,

419
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,989
the arrow buttons in
the corner over here.

420
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,370
I want you to
implement them,

421
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,130
so I'll just
hide my camera.

422
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,169
Now the difference
with this is

423
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,490
if I click on the
arrow button,

424
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,470
the player will continue

425
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,869
moving in that direction.

426
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,370
Whereas with
the arrow keys,

427
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,250
I've got to be pressing

428
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,630
the arrow key
for it to move.

429
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,090
With these
buttons, you just

430
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,509
click on it and it
will continue moving

431
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,170
the more I click.

432
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,790
Shouldn't increase
the players speed.

433
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,130
That's sometimes a
common error that I see.

434
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,949
Depending on how
you built this,

435
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,790
I'm going to die.
That's a shame.

436
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,190
That's allowing me to

437
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,810
show you the restart
feature, which is nice.

438
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,230
If I click restart,
the game restarts.

439
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,929
You can have
these players,

440
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,069
these enemy characters,
moving immediately.

441
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,390
I chose to delay it by
a couple of seconds,

442
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,309
just so it's a
bit more fun,

443
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:43,810
although it's
not particularly

444
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,690
fun at the moment.

445
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,690
But can you see that they

446
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,950
have got wall collisions?

447
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,450
The idea is when they
encounter a wall,

448
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,270
they move in the
opposite direction,

449
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,810
going to die again.

450
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm not doing very well.

451
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,049
But then once

452
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,350
the game overstate
has been reached,

453
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,070
the player movement stops.

454
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,970
That's pretty much
everything you need

455
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,390
for a grade on this one.

456
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,249
This is a good pass.

457
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,689
If you've achieved
quite a bit of this,

458
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,150
you're in quite
a good position,

459
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,770
which is nice

460
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,149
for a very good
pass. This one

461
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,870
is quite a bit
more challenging.

462
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,670
You need to ask the player

463
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,669
for their name at the,

464
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,829
at the end game state.

465
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,409
Once the players died or

466
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:21,470
collected all the points,

467
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,630
you need to ask
them for their

468
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,050
name and then save

469
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,370
their name along
with the score.

470
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,369
Apologies, I
can't talk today.

471
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,430
You're saving the
name with the score

472
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,090
the player achieved into

473
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,009
something called
local storage.

474
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,969
You're then
going to display

475
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:38,569
the five highest player

476
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,289
scores in the leaderboard.

477
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,490
The leaderboard is this
section just here.

478
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,249
You're actually going to

479
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,390
make this
leaderboard fully

480
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,569
functional based on

481
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,950
the players that have
played this game.

482
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,299
You then need to organize

483
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,719
the leaderboard from
highest to lowest.

484
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,680
Again, typically
it's built

485
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,120
in the relative order,

486
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,599
which means the
newer entries

487
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,800
will appear at the bottom.

488
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,780
You need to reorganize
this using some thing,

489
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,559
again, being quite
vague with it.

490
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,560
You need to sort it
by the highest score.

491
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,100
So it goes highest
to the lowest.

492
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm pretty sure
there's something

493
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,159
about limiting it to five.

494
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,739
There is also a
limit of five.

495
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,460
Only have the five highest

496
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,859
scores on that
leaderboard.

497
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,120
I think I missed that bit

498
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,500
annoyingly. That's fine.

499
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,160
Once you've got the
leaderboard working,

500
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,839
you then need to
add the players

501
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,980
lives using Java Script.

502
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,240
So looking at the
HTML very quickly,

503
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,359
the players
lives are added.

504
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:38,320
This just here,
these list items

505
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,020
are basically these lives,

506
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,444
they're currently hard
coded into the HTML.

507
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:46,149
Your job is to make this

508
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:49,249
fully based around
Java Script,

509
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:50,490
so you're adding
these list items

510
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,810
through Java script.

511
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,409
That's slightly
easier to do.

512
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,429
To be fair, you
then need to make

513
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,090
some functionality
that states

514
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,149
when the player collides

515
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,110
with the enemy characters.

516
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,049
Instead of it being
game over immediately,

517
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,490
you're going to
remove one of these,

518
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,270
remove one of the lives,

519
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,390
and make it so that the
player is unable to

520
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,450
move for 1.5 seconds.

521
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,990
You're then going
to put the hit

522
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,570
animation on that player,

523
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,050
again, signifying
that they've

524
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,450
been hit by the
enemy character.

525
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,070
Just to reiterate
that when you come

526
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,870
into contact with
an enemy character,

527
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,709
stop the movement
of the player.

528
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,850
Put the hit class on them,

529
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,690
and then after 1.5

530
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,990
seconds allow them
to move again.

531
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,150
But the key is
you're removing

532
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,669
one of the lives
from the screen.

533
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,950
The player essentially has

534
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,009
three attempts for this.

535
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,690
Once all three
lives are lost,

536
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,390
you're then going to

537
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,770
display that
restart message

538
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,289
or that game over message.

539
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,549
This is significantly
harder, I would say.

540
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,449
This is partly some

541
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:45,609
of the hardest criteria
on this assignment.

542
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,630
So good luck
moving forward.

543
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,210
Then let's go to B grade,
which is very fun.

544
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,029
I'm just going
to hide that

545
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:53,110
because I realize
that could

546
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,409
be not good to demonstrate
the leaderboard,

547
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,210
then I'll just collect

548
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,230
a couple of points
in the maze.

549
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,610
Aloughi get the impression
I'm going to get

550
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,230
hit in mid no, I
managed to avoid it.

551
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,910
That's good. We'll
get hit once.

552
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,650
We'll try and
get hit again.

553
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,749
So we got hit
again on that one.

554
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:12,130
We unfortunately got hit

555
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,450
third time, which is fine.

556
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,490
I'll just put my name

557
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,349
Chris in the leaderboard.

558
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,469
Click okay on that one.

559
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,929
And Chris with
a score of four

560
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,949
then got saved to
the leaderboard.

561
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:22,689
Try and restart and
do a similar process.

562
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,150
So I'll click to
govern more points.

563
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,589
We'll get hit, we
got hit again,

564
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,309
unfortunately,

565
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,629
and we got hit
on the way back.

566
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,630
As well as the way
the game goes,

567
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,109
Sometimes we'll just put

568
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:35,750
another name on this,

569
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,710
so we'll just
say John Quick.

570
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,289
Okay. And that score
added to the lead

571
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,589
of order because
that score was

572
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,269
higher than the score
I previously got,

573
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,010
that's taken the
number one position.

574
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,170
If I were to get another
score, for example,

575
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,329
two or one that would

576
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:49,549
appear in the third slot,

577
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,430
they are ordered by
the score itself,

578
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,770
and that's the
leaderboard.

579
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,430
And the cool thing is,

580
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,990
because this is
using local storage,

581
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,109
but I click refresh.

582
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:59,990
Now that leaderboard
still stays the same.

583
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,610
Now local storage is
based on your laptop,

584
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,990
so this score only exists

585
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,709
on your machine,
unfortunately,

586
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,489
until we look into
servicide languages

587
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,410
where we can save
things to databases,

588
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,509
this is about the best we

589
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,129
can do at this stage.

590
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,309
But don't worry,
you'll learn this in,

591
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,549
I think it's week 11,
which is very fun.

592
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,519
That is for a
very good purse.

593
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,679
And again, this is some of

594
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,340
the more challenging
parts of the assignment.

595
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,300
In my opinion, not
only do you need

596
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,459
to work with local storage

597
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,519
where you're
saving schools,

598
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,180
you're also sorting
those schools

599
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,840
and limiting them to five,

600
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,040
which does require
more complex logic.

601
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,180
Not only that, you're
also implementing

602
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,560
a whole life function

603
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,379
which has

604
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,360
a lot more challenges
than you might think.

605
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,560
For example, in some cases

606
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,020
you can get all
three lives

607
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,160
disappearing at
the same time.

608
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,919
That's because the
player in the enemy,

609
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,299
there's no kind
to stop on that.

610
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,579
So it's constantly
removing

611
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,480
the same life over and
over and over again.

612
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,360
So you need some way

613
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,040
of pausing that collision.

614
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,979
There's a lot to
it, unfortunately,

615
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:59,974
which you'll come out
the better for it

616
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,910
for an excellent
pass. This one's

617
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,449
a bit more fun
in my opinion.

618
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,649
You might have noticed

619
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:05,890
at this current
point there's

620
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,150
only a limited
number of points

621
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,449
we can actually
get on this maze.

622
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:09,630
The idea is
once we collect

623
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,249
all these points,
that's it.

624
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,949
Which means the
highest score

625
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:15,150
is pretty much always
going to be the same.

626
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,310
Which makes the
leader board

627
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,204
a bit less fun,
in my opinion.

628
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:22,340
What part of the excellent

629
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,599
passing criteria is,

630
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,899
is you're doing levels

631
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,439
of increasing difficulty.

632
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,500
The idea is once
the players

633
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,939
successfully collected
all those points,

634
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:32,999
you're going to
refresh the maze

635
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,039
and you're going to have

636
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,459
all those points back in.

637
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,059
Now the idea for this is

638
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,400
there's going to
be levels now.

639
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Level one could
be quite easy,

640
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,980
level two could be harder,

641
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,040
level three
could be harder.

642
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,399
You can go on
and on. Now to

643
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,279
get the most number
of marks for this,

644
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,695
the maze needs to
change for each level.

645
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,629
Now there's two ways
you can do this.

646
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,469
You can have preset
levels or for

647
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:54,889
the higher marks you

648
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,970
can randomize that
mazes creation,

649
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,309
what that means is
it's going to be

650
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,669
a random maze
every single time.

651
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,049
Just demonstrating
this slightly,

652
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,589
I go to the A grade,

653
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,410
when I click refresh.

654
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,110
It's a brand new maze
every single time.

655
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,129
If I were to collect
all these points,

656
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:14,829
I move on to level two and

657
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,729
it's a new maze that
gets refreshed.

658
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:17,989
The idea is in theory,

659
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,124
this game could
go on forever.

660
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,400
Now part of the
requirement

661
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,619
is levels of
increasing difficulty.

662
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,600
One way of achieving
this is to add

663
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,999
more enemies to the game

664
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,539
as the levels increase.

665
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,159
For example, level
one could have

666
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,400
one enemy character
like I've got here.

667
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,919
The second I get
to level two,

668
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,460
there's then two
enemy characters,

669
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,619
three enemy characters,

670
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,719
four enemy characters for

671
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,379
every single level
that goes up.

672
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,299
Now if you had an infinite
number of levels,

673
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,999
there would need to
be some cap on this.

674
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,439
Otherwise you'd
end up with like

675
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,220
1,000 enemies at level

676
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,319
1,000 Maybe it caps off at

677
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,359
maybe ten enemies when it

678
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,369
gets a bit more
unmanageable.

679
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,979
But the real key to this

680
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:57,659
is it's going to be
a randomized maze.

681
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,140
For each level, there's

682
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,279
bonus marks if there

683
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,700
are an infinite
number of levels.

684
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,659
And the nice thing is that

685
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,059
it's quite easy
to achieve,

686
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,580
which is nice Now

687
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,699
you would lose marks if

688
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,340
the maze is
impossible to solve.

689
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,999
What I mean by that is if

690
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:13,020
we had a wall here
and a wall here,

691
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,300
my player
character wouldn't

692
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,099
be able to get
these two points.

693
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,819
There doesn't need
to be something in

694
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,119
place to stop that
from happening.

695
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,279
Annoyingly,

696
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,780
that took me quite
a while to solve.

697
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,620
It's actually a
very easy issue,

698
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,019
but hopefully you
guys figure it

699
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,540
out a lot quicker
than me on that one.

700
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,779
Let's try and get to
level two on this one.

701
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,980
So unfortunately,
you've got to watch

702
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,920
me very slowly go
through this game,

703
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,680
which is fun, to be fair,

704
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,539
is quite a fun game to

705
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:44,639
the idea is as soon as I

706
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,699
collect all of
these points,

707
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,740
which we are very
nearly there,

708
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,679
it's going to wait for

709
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,140
that character to move.

710
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,140
I'm playing it
dangerously. Now

711
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,759
of course, he's going to

712
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,379
go right where
I need to go.

713
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:12,079
That's fine. There we go.

714
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,359
So as soon as
I collect this

715
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,499
last point just here,

716
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:18,440
it tells me the level
has been completed.

717
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,499
It then gives me

718
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,160
a new maze and the
game continues.

719
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,780
But this time because
I'm on level two,

720
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,160
I've got

721
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,699
two enemy characters
I'm dealing with.

722
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,960
But you can see
in theory I could

723
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,100
get like an
infinite number

724
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,779
of points on this.

725
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:33,959
Now we'll just try
and die very quickly,

726
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,379
so I can get

727
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,959
a very nice high score
for when I show this

728
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:42,300
in class, I am.

729
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,509
Oh come on. There we go.

730
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,149
I'll just say
Chris two on that

731
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:51,910
one now at my score of 67,

732
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,249
find to the
leaderboard like

733
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:56,330
so that's the key to
success for that one.

734
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,609
In theory, this
game could go on

735
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,450
forever, forever and ever.

736
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,189
And it's still got the
same functionalities.

737
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:03,430
I click restart, the
game restart as well.

738
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,869
That was unfortunate,
but the point with

739
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,089
the grade is it's not

740
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,290
premade levels,
it's infinite.

741
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,029
If you did do premade
levels, for example,

742
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,930
level one is this and
level two is this maze,

743
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,329
and level three
is this maze.

744
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,109
That would get
you some marks.

745
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:19,830
But if it's completely
randomized every time,

746
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,269
that's the key to the

747
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,710
highest grade
boundary on that one.

748
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,069
Now the last
requirement for this,

749
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,390
and it's the one
that I really

750
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,610
encourage most
people to try,

751
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,969
because I think
it's quite fun.

752
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:32,529
It adds a bit more
personalization to this,

753
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,310
is I want you to add

754
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,789
two unique features
to this game.

755
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,389
The more complex
the features,

756
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,190
the higher the
mark you will get.

757
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,070
If it were me, I
would possibly

758
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,189
look at doing some kind
of power up feature.

759
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:45,509
In traditional Pac Man,

760
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,989
you get the fruit

761
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:48,109
that's slightly
different from

762
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,029
the rest of the fruit,

763
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,409
that gives you
more points.

764
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,984
You could do
something like that,

765
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,860
for example, you
could have maybe

766
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,099
a red point
somewhere on this,

767
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,360
you collect the red
point that gives

768
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,339
you ten in your score.

769
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,299
You could add
modifiers to it.

770
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,919
For example, if you
were to collect

771
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,959
a certain thing
in the maze,

772
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:05,639
it would speed up

773
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,879
your character
for 10 seconds.

774
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:09,539
Or it makes you
invisible or invincible,

775
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,100
that's the word
I'm meant to use.

776
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,939
Or you could take it
literally from Pac Man.

777
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:14,279
You could allow
yourself to

778
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,960
defeat the enemies in
the maze temporarily.

779
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,500
If you come into
contact with them,

780
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,020
they're the ones that
die and disappear.

781
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,779
You can even do

782
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,659
a character customizer
if you really want to.

783
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,519
This is going to be one of

784
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,240
your exercises in
two weeks time.

785
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,519
We're actually
going to create

786
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,999
some character
customize it

787
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,479
very easy to just port
that over into this,

788
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,939
but the key is the more
complex the feature,

789
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,959
the higher the mark
you receive on this.

790
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,740
I would encourage
most people

791
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,659
to give this one a go.

792
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,720
I think that's something I

793
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,700
quite like with
this assignment.

794
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,440
A lot of people think

795
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,860
they have to do
this in order,

796
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,820
not necessarily the case

797
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,640
if you think there's
a few things,

798
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,199
let's say in the
very good pass,

799
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,880
that seem easier
than this one.

800
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,419
In a good pass, you

801
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,644
can add those
for those marks.

802
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,109
Even if you haven't
achieved all of this,

803
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,110
you can still do some
of the requirements

804
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,029
for an A grade,
for a B grade.

805
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,569
Each of these have
a certain number

806
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,290
of points
allocated to them.

807
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,349
All you're going to do is

808
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:07,609
rack up those points.

809
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,570
You don't have to
follow a specific order

810
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,930
on this, if that
makes sense.

811
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,050
I would say is a major
requirement though.

812
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,089
Everyone needs to have
done the past grade.

813
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,690
The past grade has
the most number

814
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,130
of marks to it
because that's enough

815
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,629
to get you that 40%
40% for the D minus.

816
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:23,069
The rest of this
stuff is only

817
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,310
maybe ten marks each.

818
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,209
Ten marks between
each grade boundary,

819
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:27,965
if that makes sense.

820
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,679
But yeah, have
some fun with it.

821
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,759
I'll just go through a

822
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,140
bit more on the
assignment.

823
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,999
You've got a few
different CSS

824
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,420
classes at your disposal.

825
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,359
The big ones are
obviously hashtag player,

826
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,619
which is an ID
for the player

827
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,299
that's that Pac
Man character.

828
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,399
There's a secondary
action for these players.

829
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,160
There's the hit class
and the dead class.

830
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
The dead class gives

831
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,300
you that death animation,

832
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,319
whereas the hit class
gives you that hit.

833
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,620
It's being hit animation.

834
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,439
We then have
classes for the

835
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,559
points and the
enemies as well.

836
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,460
But hopefully it's quite

837
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,454
straightforward
from the CSS.

838
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,949
Now for the actual
assignment submission,

839
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,609
you need to
create a report.

840
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:03,769
This report is
going to be very

841
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,069
different from the
report you made for

842
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,609
the first assignment
because this one's

843
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:09,249
got quite a lot of
marks associated to it.

844
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,249
You're going to have

845
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:11,709
three sections
in this report.

846
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,709
The first one is
a checklist of

847
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,290
all the completed
functionality

848
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,070
that you've done.

849
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,549
I'm going to give
you a template to

850
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,970
use for this in a
couple of weeks time.

851
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,050
That's got every single

852
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,729
feature I'm looking for.

853
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,349
Everything in all of

854
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,849
this nice thing is you

855
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:25,490
can use it to track

856
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,610
your progress,
which is good.

857
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,489
All you need to do is

858
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:28,670
just tell me what
you've done.

859
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,249
If you've done all
the past grade,

860
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:31,770
you'll tick all of these.

861
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,229
Just make marking a
little bit easier on me.

862
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:34,709
Otherwise,

863
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:37,000
it'll be scouring
through a lot of code.

864
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,349
That's the first
one. Just tell me

865
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:40,190
exactly what you've

866
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,929
done using that checklist.

867
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:44,070
The second section
is testing,

868
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,529
so we're going to
focus a lot more

869
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,950
on testing in some
of the later weeks.

870
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,890
But you've got to show

871
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,389
me how the code
is working.

872
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,270
What tests have
you performed

873
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,610
that guarantee that's

874
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,389
working? As you've stated.

875
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,709
Could you test
certain sections

876
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,029
without running
all the code?

877
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,329
A bit of a hint you can,

878
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,430
then this is quite
a unique one.

879
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,790
If there are any
bugs in your game,

880
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,930
if you disclose them here,

881
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,949
you won't be marked down

882
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,810
quite as heavily for them.

883
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,429
Again, if you know some of

884
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:13,244
it doesn't work,
mention it

885
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:16,640
for the evaluation.
Essentially, you're

886
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,019
just going to say what

887
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,579
happened throughout
this process.

888
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,979
Again, any known bugs

889
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,200
or weaknesses in the game.

890
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,720
Tell me what works
well in the game.

891
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,280
If you're very proud

892
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,219
of your collision
teection,

893
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,860
maybe it's 100% accurate
every single time.

894
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,039
Talk about that. If you

895
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,759
had more time or
what would you do?

896
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,480
What improvements could
you make to the game?

897
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,660
What would you have
done if you were given

898
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,879
an extra week or an
extra month on this?

899
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,939
How easy is it to extend

900
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:40,600
the functionality
for this game?

901
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,419
Have you built it in

902
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:42,739
such a way that
it's very modular?

903
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,279
You just need to
create a new function

904
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,400
and then bag it's working?

905
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,240
Or is it very
much written into

906
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,520
one solid block where

907
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,619
a tiny tweak here or

908
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:51,500
there could break
everything.

909
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,519
The last one is
if you had to

910
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,619
build a similar
game in the future,

911
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,539
what would you do
differently and why you

912
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,439
get to express your
English skills,

913
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,619
which is very fun.

914
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,219
The last little
bit is then

915
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,899
a link to your video
demonstration.

916
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,259
This video
demonstration is a

917
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,580
bit longer than the
first assignment,

918
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,559
just because
you've essentially

919
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,580
got to show me
everything you've

920
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,940
done, two to 5 minutes.

921
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,820
Try not to make it
any longer than ten,

922
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,879
otherwise that's going to

923
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,660
be very painful to watch.

924
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,799
But essentially, you're
just going to show me

925
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,320
all the features you've
added to that game.

926
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,580
You don't need to
show me the code,

927
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,520
it's just the game
itself. Okay?

928
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,379
You also need to
copy and paste

929
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,919
all your code into
a Word document

930
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,279
and scan that
through turn in,

931
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,280
just like the
first assignment.

932
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,619
The actual rubric itself,

933
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,100
the functionality part,

934
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,459
the stuff you're adding

935
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:42,759
to this is worth
60% of your grade.

936
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,160
It's quite a big chunk.

937
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,619
All of this stuff, this

938
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,239
is all worth 60%
of that grade.

939
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,320
Again, don't look
at that lightly.

940
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,620
It's the biggest section
in this assignment

941
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,099
for the evaluation
and testing.

942
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,719
This is mostly the
report section.

943
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,340
They're 10% each,
That's 20% Again,

944
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,379
it does have to be
quite a good report.

945
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,124
I would say maybe five
pages is even that.

946
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:09,109
But again, 20
whole percent,

947
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:11,230
that's quite a lot code

948
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,369
quality and efficiency.

949
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:13,749
That's where I'm
specifically

950
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:14,410
going to be looking

951
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,709
at your code and
seeing how good it is.

952
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:18,309
If you've got a lot of
duplication in there,

953
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,310
are you using a good
range of functions?

954
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,209
Are you using four
loops? If statements,

955
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,390
everything we're
going to go through.

956
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,829
Are you using
it effectively?

957
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,709
That's where 15% then

958
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,089
you've got 5% of the
video demonstration.

959
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,770
But just like the
first assignment,

960
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,969
this is more of a pass or

961
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,849
fail section
on the rubric.

962
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:34,870
You've either done

963
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,549
a good video
demonstration where it

964
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,789
proves that
that's your code

965
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,169
or there's a bit
of ambiguity.

966
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,509
There were a bit unsure

967
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,670
and that's where
you'll fail

968
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,989
that section and
be called in for

969
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,674
a secondary
interview for that.

970
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:48,120
But that is the
second assignment.

971
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,099
So remember, you've got

972
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,539
quite a lot of
time to do this,

973
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:51,900
so don't panic just yet.

974
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,380
You've even got two
weeks over Easter,

975
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,039
surprisingly,

976
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,519
but we will come
back to this as

977
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,240
each week goes
on after today,

978
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,580
you can actually
do the first two

979
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,499
requirements of this game.

980
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:03,860
So again, if you're doing

981
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,980
the exercises each week,

982
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,739
it should be very easy
to kind of see what

983
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:09,639
this game becomes
in the end.

984
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,899
So that's my biggest
step to you just do

985
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:13,259
the exercises
each week and

986
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,860
you should be
absolutely fine.

987
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,080
Okay, so that is the
second assignment.

988
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,019
I hope everyone is

989
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,279
feeling al right
about that.

990
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,459
I think it's quite fun.

991
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,159
It's definitely one of

992
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,740
the more interactive
assignments out there.

993
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,559
The nice thing is
you can actually

994
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,839
add this to your
portfolios from

995
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,759
the first
assignment if you

996
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,039
wanted to actually let

997
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,720
employers see
your own work,

998
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,899
which I quite like.

999
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,079
You can even add this to

1000
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,199
an eye frame if
you wanted to.

1001
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,039
You might need to optimize
it a bit further,

1002
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,440
but that's

1003
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,060
just some standard
CSS properties here.

1004
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,519
I think Mark told me
very early on when I was

1005
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,880
a student that if
you're very passionate

1006
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,680
about an assignment,

1007
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
you tend to do quite well.

1008
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,900
In that the more excited

1009
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,219
you are about adding
things to this,

1010
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,819
about learning
parts to it,

1011
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:53,219
it tends to be the
better you'll do.

1012
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm quite a big gamer.
You can probably

1013
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,070
tell from all that
stuff over there.

1014
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,959
I'm really into this.

1015
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,280
I love this sort of stuff.

1016
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,739
It's probably the
assignment I was

1017
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:04,399
most passionate about
when I was a student.

1018
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,420
So hopefully some of
you feel the same way.

1019
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,259
Maybe this isn't
your capti at all.

1020
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,900
Maybe you really don't
like this stuff.

1021
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,000
That's absolutely fine.

1022
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
There will be modules
that you enjoy.

1023
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,739
This is going to be

1024
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:15,200
modules that you
don't enjoy.

1025
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,280
But I think finding
the passion

1026
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,679
in a lot of this stuff,
it's the way forward.

1027
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,339
Okay, a nice thing is

1028
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:22,960
we're all starting
at the same point.

1029
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,199
So I'm not going to assume

1030
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,919
anyone's got any Java
script knowledge.

1031
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,100
We're going to start
right from square one.

1032
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,500
Right from step one.

1033
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,775
Okay, that's the
second assignment.

1034
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,270
Yeah, good luck.
I'm going to start

1035
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,270
the first lecture
in just a second.

1036
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,569
But I'm going to pause

1037
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,689
this so I can then
edit it a little bit.

1038
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:43,930
Nicer. Yeah, I will see
you in just a second.
